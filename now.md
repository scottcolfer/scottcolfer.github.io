I'm joining [Herd Consulting](https://herd.consulting/) as Director of Product. Herd's already a successful specialist business analysis consultancy and delivery partner. I'm leading the development of a new product management side to the business. I shared more about my new role on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scottcolfer_product-productmanagement-productleadership-activity-7130206807070793728-07_S?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and Herd shared an [update](https://herd.consulting/welcome-scott-colfer) too. Get in touch if you'd like to work together in 2024.
