# E-book Now On Sale On [Amazon](https://amzn.eu/d/2TenSoh).

### Most product advice is for SaaS startups. This book is for everyone else.

**It’s not about frameworks or buzzwords. It’s about what product actually looks like when you’re working with the real people, legacy systems, and power dynamics. When transformation means working with care, not just tech.**

Based on the experiences of Scott Colfer, PRODUCT IN SERVICE is a short, sharp manifesto for a more human kind of product management: one that helps you navigate complexity, build trust, and make progress without the hype.

**"Definitely feeling 'seen' as a product leader, Scott describes the product mindset in the best teams."** *Rachel Woods, Deputy Director of Product, Universal Credit* 

**"The last book like this I picked up and wanted to finish in one go was 'The Phoenix Project.'"** *Taidhgh O’Regan, Product Director, University of Nottingham*

**"Says a lot of things I've been dying to see talked about publicly."** *Alex Sturtivant, Product Lead, Royal Borough of Greenwich*
