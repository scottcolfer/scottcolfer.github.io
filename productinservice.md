# A Manifesto for Pragmatic Product Management

### Most product advice is for SaaS startups. This book is for everyone else.

**It’s not about frameworks or buzzwords. It’s about what product actually looks like when you’re working with the real people, legacy systems, and power dynamics. When transformation means working with care, not just tech.**

This book is for product people working in complex services like healthcare, education, and public services. It’s about what product actually looks like when you’re supporting people with complex needs, legacy systems, policy, and power. When transformation means dealing with people, not just tech.

Based on the experiences of Scott Colfer, PRODUCT IN SERVICE is a short, sharp manifesto for a more human kind of product management: one that helps you navigate complexity, build trust, and make progress without the hype.

| **"Definitely feeling 'seen' as a product leader, Scott describes the product mindset in the best teams** | **"The last book like this I picked up and wanted to finish in one go was 'The Phoenix Project'"** | **"Says a lot of things I've been dying to see talked about publicly."** |
