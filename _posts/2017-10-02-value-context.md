Vision
Better described as ‘value manager’.
Value strategy. Uncover the value context. then create value stratgey.

Value manager also helps our colleagues that we can work in the intangible space known as 'senior leadership’. 'Product’ is a tangible thing and makes our colleague think that 'you don’t need a product manager when there’s no product’. However, 'portfolio’ is just another type of backlog, & all the tricks we’ve learned in development teams work in portfolio teams.

Add description of product manager from value book:

"A core principle of Agile and Lean theory is that software development should seek to maximise business value. Projects should be judged not on their adherence to cost and schedue milestones, but on their delivery of value to the enterprise. Value should be delivered as quickly as possible - in small increments - and features should be prioritised based on the amount of value they deliver."

'We all understand the goal of private value - it's to generate profit and return value to shareholders. The ultimate goal of public services is not to generate profit, and we don't have shareholders. So what's 'public value'? You could argue that the financial objective of public value is to hit targets for liquidity: having just enough resources to carry out the mission, but not too much. The criteria for its success - its definition of business value - is about accomplishing its mission." p27

"A government agency has other value concerns beyond those directly related to its mission area."
'It values fairness in procurement practices, transparency, public accountability, and the political goals of those in power. Government is unique in that one of its resources is its authority to compel behaviour but doing so also has an opportunity cost. The magnitude of the punishment for for non-compliance is a cost to society.'
'The government places a high value on trnasparency.' Trust. 'Whilst companies can keep secrets, government is accountable to the public and must disclose its actions and decisions. There is value assigned to demonstrating trustworthiness. The government is always in the public eye, with the press always reporting on government.' p58 
'Government is in an environment that is quick to assign blame and has become highly risk averse, so places value on things that mitigate risk.'
