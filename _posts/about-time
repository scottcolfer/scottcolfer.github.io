Who's got time for digital transformation?



Business models change over time, and our business strategy needs to change over time too. "Agile approaches added a time dimension where previously there was none [...] The Waterfall model was based on taking a point-in-time snapshot of the information we know and using it to create a long-term plan that we would adhere to. The Agile insight was that we should change our notion of what features will create business value over time as more information becomes available [...] Agile approaches added a time dimension where previously there was none." ***The Art of Business Value**, Mark Schwartz*
'Delivery is the strategy' was the rallying call of digital transformation in government for the longest time but we're now being told that 'the era of move fast and break things is over'. What's the truth?

The truth is that 'delivery is the strategy' is a tactic, it's something used at the beginning of digital transformation to build an organisation's emotional confidence in a new way of working. This rallying call is often interpretted as 'the delivery of stuff' is the strategy - and we quickly build up a lot of stuff that needs to demonstrate return on investment and be supported and maintained.
Equally, the era is of moving fast and breaking things is not over. We are just realising that delivery isn't the whole strategy. We need to go broader and deeper. Beyond 'brand-new' and public-facing, into legacy and 'staff-facing'. 
The truth is that the era of lurching from one extreme to another is over. We can't exclusively focus in delivering 'stuff', but we do need to move fast and break stuff.
We need to stop the all or nothing mentality that drives us to lurch from one extrem to the other. We need mutliple sets of conditions that co-exist, and to start using them both where and when they are most useful.

## Explore or exploit?

 | **Explore** | **Exploit** 
 --- | --- | ---
Strategy | Radical or disruptive innovation, new business model innovation | Incremental innovation, optimising existing business model 
Structure | Small cross-functional multiskilled team | Multiple teams aligned using principle of mission 
Culture | High tolerance for experimentation, risk taking, acceptance of failure, focus on learning  | Incremental improvement optimisation, focus on quality and customer satisfaction
Risk management | Biggest risk is failure to hit product/market fit | A more complex set of trade-offs specific to each product/service
Goals | Creating new opportunities, discovering new opportunities within existing portfolio | Maximising yield from existing opportunities
Measure of progress | Achieving product/market fit | Outperforming forecasts, achieving planned milestones and targets

This is also known as 'business strategy' - it's what delivery teams are looking for from their leadership teams - it's what our digital strategies should be full of
