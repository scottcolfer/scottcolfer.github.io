Agile: time dimension introduced

'Delivery is the strategy' was the rallying call of digital transformation in government for the longest time but we're now being told that 'the era of move fast and break things is over'. The truth is that 'delivery is the strategy' is a tactic, it's something used at the beginning of digital transformation to build an organisation's emotional confidence in a new way of working. The era is of moving fast and breaking things isn't over, it's just realised that it doesn't hold all the answers and needs to go broader and deeper - beyond brand-new and public-facing, into legacy and staff-facing. 

The era of 'move fast and break things' ins't over. We still need that. But it can no longer be our exclusive focus. We need at least two sets of coniditions - explore, and exploit - we need to stop the all or nothing mentality that drives us to lurch from one to the other, and start using them both where and when they are most useful.

This is also known as 'business strategy' - it's what delivery teams are looking for from their leadership teams - it's what our digital strategies should be full of
