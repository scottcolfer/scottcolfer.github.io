title: "The Five Stages of Applying the Digital Service Standard to Technical Stuff"

##1. Denial

**You** "I'm working on a platform/API/component/infrastructure product/etc . . . it's a technical 'thing'' for internal use, the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) doesn't apply."

**Inner You** "Yes it does. You know it does. Look deep within yourself young padawan."

## 2. Anger

**You** "It's not public facing! It doesn't even have users! It's an internal, technical thing! It has "

**Inner You** "[Civil servants are users too](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/09/28/civil-servants-are-users-too/). User-centred design ftw. "

## 3. Bargaining

**You** "OK, I get that it's got users . . . but loads of the standards don't apply. How do I do something like '[be consistent with the rest of GOV.UK including design patterns and style guide](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/make-the-user-experience-consistent-with-govuk)' when building something like an API?"

**Inner You** "Developers are users. They need technical documentation to use the API. Technical documentation = content. The page that the content sits on needs to be designed. The value of your API is only released if the technical documentation works. Your API needs a service wrapper. You've created a service. The service standards apply.""

## 4. Depression

**You** "But that means that I need a [multidisciplinary team](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/have-a-multidisciplinary-team). I'll never get a User Researcher for this work. Or a Content Designer."

**Inner You** "You also need that team to exist for as long as your technical product exits. If it becomes a critical dependency for multiple other products then a service desk, incident response and iteration are crucial . . . "

**You** :(

**Inner You** ". . . but teams around government are making this case successfully! Platforms, components and technical products are increasingly going the the same [phases of development](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery) as public-facing services. Here's the [Alpha assessment for PaaS](https://www.gov.uk/service-standard-reports/platform-as-a-service-paas)."

## 5. Acceptance

**You** "So . . . I can get a multidisciplinary team to work on my technical thing, that is actually a service for internal users? That's actually quite exciting."

**Inner You** "Yes. You'll need to help your colleagues understand that you're working on a service, the same as them, but once they do then you'll get the help you need."

**You** :)
