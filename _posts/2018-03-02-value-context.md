Why is business strategy in its infancy? 
Agile forgets to speak about what value actually is.
Value is context specific. 
Product manager provices value context.
Product leadership is about providing value context.

The Art of Business Value by Mark Schwartz

Why are we doing this exploration of value?

"The Waterfall model was based on taking a point-in-time snapshot of the information we know and using it to create a long-term plan that we would adhere to. The Agile insight was that we should change our notion of what features will create business value *over time* as more information becomes available and, in fact, that it can be worth an investment even just to incrase learning, thereby reducing uncertainty and opening a space in which innovation can occur. Agile approaches added a time dimension where previously there was none. But the meaning of business value itself was a given [...] known to the business, and that is not good enough." p.83

Don't get lost in all of this.
Remember that value of users is primary. Need to meet needs of everyone. Accessibility. Assistance.

This is an important point. It's easy to get lost in government. Show how org value contexts are sometimes more complicated than those of our users. Run the risk that it takes more time and effort to meet the needs of the contexts of the government & the civil service than it does to meet the needs of our users.
For this reason: Our business strategy - simplify our value contexts.

Vision
Better described as ‘value manager’.
Value strategy. Uncover the value context. then create value stratgey.

Value manager also helps our colleagues that we can work in the intangible space known as 'senior leadership’. 'Product’ is a tangible thing and makes our colleague think that 'you don’t need a product manager when there’s no product’. However, 'portfolio’ is just another type of backlog, & all the tricks we’ve learned in development teams work in portfolio teams.

Add description of product manager from value book:

"A core principle of Agile and Lean theory is that software development should seek to maximise business value. Projects should be judged not on their adherence to cost and schedue milestones, but on their delivery of value to the enterprise. Value should be delivered as quickly as possible - in small increments - and features should be prioritised based on the amount of value they deliver." Early page

'We all understand the goal of private value - it's to generate profit and return value to shareholders. The ultimate goal of public services is not to generate profit, and we don't have shareholders. So what's 'public value'? You could argue that the financial objective of public value is to hit targets for liquidity: having just enough resources to carry out the mission, but not too much. The criteria for its success - its definition of business value - is about accomplishing its mission." p27

"The ultimate financial objective of a nonprofit cannot be maximising sharedolder value, since it has no shareholders. According to John Zietlow, Jo Ann Hankin, and Alan Seidner in their book on nonprofit financial management, the correct financial concern for a nonprofit should be hitting targets for liquidity: having just enough resources to carry out the mission, but not too much. But even for Zietlow, who's speciality is financial management, it would be misleading to think of business value solely in financial terms: "the public service nature of a nonprofit poses a major challenge in terms of identifying and articulating its mission and and developing criteria for measuring its success." The criteria for its success - that is, its definition of business value - is about accomplishing the mission for which it was chartered." p.27

"A government agency has other value concerns beyond those directly related to its mission area [...] it values fairness in procurement practices: all contractors and suppliers should have equal chances to compete for government business. It values transparency, public accontability, and the political goals of those in power. Clearly shareholder value is not what is meant by business value in the context of a government agency; even mission value might be rather an oversimplification. On the other hand, there are similarities between the public sector and the private sector. As Mark Moore points out, the goal of a public sector organisation can be thought of as delivering *public* value, just as that of a corporation is to deliver *private* value. Both types of organisation must make value-based trade-offs in the use of resources for which there is an opportunity cost, typically cash - in one case the cash of shareholders, in the other case the cash from tax-payers. The government is unique in that one of its resources is its authority to compel behaviour, but doing so also has an opportunity cost. The magnitude of the punishment for non-compliance, for example, is a cost to society. Moore examines several ways of thinking about public value [...] agencies are generally given conflicting or inchoerent guidance by their political overseers." p??

"When you 'provoke and observe' in the government environment, you discover what its true values are. The government is based on a system of 'checks and balances' - in other words, a system of distrust. The great freedom enjoyed by the press, especially in reporting on the actions of government, is another indication of the public's lack of trust in the government. As a result, you find that the government places a high value on transparency. While companies can keep secrets, government is accountable to the public and must disclose its actions and decisions. There is a business need for continued demonstrations of trustworthiness, or we might as well say a business value assigned to demonstrating trustworthiness. You find that the government is always in the public eye - the press is always reporting on government actions, and the public is quick to outrage. Government agencies, therefore, place a business value on 'optics' - howw something appears to the observant public." p.58  

"Public service in an environment that is quick to assign blame, government is highly risk averse (i.e., it places high business value on things that mitigate risk). [...] When an agile team self organises to meet business needs and deliver business value, it cannot just consider customer and user needs for its products. It must consider all of the needs of the organisation and all of the things the business values, and then self-organise to meet all of those needs. The needs disclosed by bureaucratic rules are among those needs." p.??

What everyone gets wrong about stakeholder https://melissaperri.com/blog/stakeholders Stakeholders have specific influence and knowledge that can help your product.


My thought is that public value in government is a combination of:

- mission value
- political value

Sometimes, these may be in conflict.
Political needs may not have been clearly expressed to us, and may be disclosed by our bureaucratic rules.

What's the point of a product manager? 
- to provide a high level business value context.

"Is it possible that the product owner role feels like a good idea because it helps fit Agile practices into a command-and-control hierarchy?" p.85

"The product owner can be seen in a different light. Rather than being the authority of business value, making business value tradeoffs down to the feature level, the product owner can also be seen as the *visionary* responsible for a product or system, the person who communicates a vision behind a product and steers its development and evolution, the person who establishes a high level business value *context* in which the team generates solutions.
The concept of the product owner's role makes all the more sense now that we have come to think of a business as a type of Complex Adaptive System (CAS). A CAS is a self-organising system with non-linearities and complex interactions, one in which leadership can influence, but not control, outcomes. An important function of leadership in a CAS is to provide context and incentives that nudge the system towards the desired outcomes. In John Henry Clippinger III's book 'The Biology of Business', a business organisation is presented as a Darwinian universe in which leaders and managers can set parameters that determine what ideas and behaviours are most likely to survive: 'Management cannot, and need not, have perfect information; the challenge of management is to create the conditions and contexts that select for a range of desired outcomes as in the processes of natural selection.'" p.??

"The role of leadership and management in a CAS is to influence the evolutionary process so that the organisation delivers on its goals. Leaders create the language of the organisation; they set up incentives and define value in a way that elicits the descired outcomes. They define what it *valued* in order to deliver on the organisation's mission." p.88

"Business value is a hypothesis held by the organisation's leadership as to what will best accomplish the organisation's ultimate goals or desired outcomes." p.90
