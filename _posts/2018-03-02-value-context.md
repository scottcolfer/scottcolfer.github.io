The Art of Business Value by Mark Schwartz

Don't get lost in all of this.
Remember that value of users is primary. Need to meet needs of everyone. Accessibility. Assistance.

This is an important point. It's easy to get lost in government. Show how org value contexts are sometimes more complicated than those of our users. Run the risk that it takes more time and effort to meet the needs of the contexts of the government & the civil service than it does to meet the needs of our users.
For this reason: Our business strategy - simplify our value contexts.

Vision
Better described as ‘value manager’.
Value strategy. Uncover the value context. then create value stratgey.

Value manager also helps our colleagues that we can work in the intangible space known as 'senior leadership’. 'Product’ is a tangible thing and makes our colleague think that 'you don’t need a product manager when there’s no product’. However, 'portfolio’ is just another type of backlog, & all the tricks we’ve learned in development teams work in portfolio teams.

Add description of product manager from value book:

"A core principle of Agile and Lean theory is that software development should seek to maximise business value. Projects should be judged not on their adherence to cost and schedue milestones, but on their delivery of value to the enterprise. Value should be delivered as quickly as possible - in small increments - and features should be prioritised based on the amount of value they deliver." Early page

'We all understand the goal of private value - it's to generate profit and return value to shareholders. The ultimate goal of public services is not to generate profit, and we don't have shareholders. So what's 'public value'? You could argue that the financial objective of public value is to hit targets for liquidity: having just enough resources to carry out the mission, but not too much. The criteria for its success - its definition of business value - is about accomplishing its mission." p27

"The ultimate financial objective of a nonprofit cannot be maximising sharedolder value, since it has no shareholders. According to John Zietlow, Jo Ann Hankin, and Alan Seidner in their book on nonprofit financial management, the correct financial concern for a nonprofit should be hitting targets for liquidity: having just enough resources to carry out the mission, but not too much. But even for Zietlow, who's speciality is financial management, it would be misleading to think of business value solely in financial terms: "the public service nature of a nonprofit poses a major challenge in terms of identifying and articulating its mission and and developing criteria for measuring its success." The criteria for its success - that is, its definition of business value - is about accomplishing the mission for which it was chartered." p.27

"A government agency has other value concerns beyond those directly related to its mission area [...] it values fairness in procurement practices: all contractors and suppliers should have equal chances to compete for government business. It values transparency, public accontability, and the political goals of those in power. Clearly shareholder value is not what is meant by business value in the context of a government agency; even mission value might be rather an oversimplification. On the other hand, there are similarities between the public sector and the private sector. As Mark Moore points out, the goal of a public sector organisation can be thought of as delivering *public* value, just as that of a corporation is to deliver *private* value. Both types of organisation must make value-based trade-offs in the use of resources for which there is an opportunity cost, typically cash - in one case the cash of shareholders, in the other case the cash from tax-payers. The government is unique in that one of its resources is its authority to compel behaviour, but doing so also has an opportunity cost. The magnitude of the punishment for non-compliance, for example, is a cost to society. Moore examines several ways of thinking about public value [...] agencies are generally given conflicting or inchoerent guidance by their political overseers." p??


'The government places a high value on trnasparency.' Trust. 'Whilst companies can keep secrets, government is accountable to the public and must disclose its actions and decisions. There is value assigned to demonstrating trustworthiness. The government is always in the public eye, with the press always reporting on government.' p58 
'Government is in an environment that is quick to assign blame and has become highly risk averse, so places value on things that mitigate risk.'

My thought is that public value in government is a combination of:
- mission value
- political value
Sometimes, these may be in conflict.
