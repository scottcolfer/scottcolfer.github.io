I was rencently throwing out some old receipts and was suprised to find that I bought my first espresso machine eight years ago - it made me realise that I've come a long way since those first bitter, watery attempts back when the UK was starting prepartion to host the Olympics. Here's what I've learned in that time.

## Why espresso?

There are loads of reasons why [you shouldn't bother making your own espresso at home](https://scottcolfer.com/coffee/2017/12/24/manual-espresso-at-home.html) but for me it's my go-to type of coffee. Espresso is thicker and has more concentrated falvours than most other types of coffee, and you can drink a couple of them because they contain less caffeine than other types of coffee (caffeine is more concentrated in espresso than other coffees but the overall small volume means there's less caffeine in total. I also enjoy the simple fact that I can make decent espresso at home - it's something that lots of people don't have the kit, the patience, or the practice to do - so I take pleasure in making it and friends enjoy the novelty of drinking it. 

## Coffee beans

Coffee beans have different flavours based on a bunch of factors like where they're grown, how they grown, how the flesh of the coffee cherry is removed from the coffee bean, and how the coffee beans are roasted - the 'perfect' coffee is the one you most enjoy. The factor that's often had the most impact on what coffee I enjoy (and the kit I need to make my espresso) is how the coffee is roasted. I was at [Spa Terminus](https://spa-terminus.co.uk/) in London a few years back and got talking about coffee roasting with a coffee roaster called  [Jack Coleman](https://twitter.com/ColemanCoffee) - I'd just had a go at roasting my own coffee and the results had been rubbish. One of the things that Jack explained to me was that coffee has two 'cracks' when it's roasted: the first 'crack' denotes the first point at which you'll get drinkable coffee - before this point the coffee beans remain green and produce undrinkable coffee; the second 'crack' denotes the last point at which you'll get drinkable coffee - after this point you've got burned coffee beans and the coffee will taste like ash. This is the scale for coffee roasting - first crack is the lightest roast possible - second crack is the darkest roast possible. The 'Italian' style coffee beans we get in the UK tend to be towards the darker end of the scale, where you're tasting the roasting process along with the taste of the bean itself (this is why it can taste bitter, and why Italian-style espresso sometimes benefits from sugar) - in my experience, this helps to produce a more consistent coffee bean - and seems to be what the entry-level home expresso kit can handle pretty well. However, my natural preference is for the ligther coffee beans where I can taste more of the bean itself and more of the natural sweetness of the coffee cherry - I never need to add sugar to this type of espresso. In my experience, the downside to light roasts and some medium roasts is that they're less consistent and there's more of a need to fine-tune my espresso kit to get decent results - somethings that's not possible with the cheapest, most entry-level kit.

I've had a few favourite roasters over the years - [Nude Espresso](https://www.nudeespresso.com/), [Monmouth Coffee](https://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/), [Workshop Coffee](https://workshopcoffee.com/), [Allpress](https://uk.allpressespresso.com/) - but what they've got in commmon (other than selling really nice medium/light roasted espresso beans) is that they were in some way local to me at the time of buying - either near to my home, or on the way to work. We're spoiled for good coffee roasters in the UK and in lots of towns and cities there are excellent coffee roasters within a few miles. I currently drink [Square Mile Coffee](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/)'s espresso blends - the coffee beans are excellent - the roastery started in Hackney (my home borough of London) - and it's stocked in my local coffee shop, 46b Espresso Hut, so I can easily buy it when I need it. 

My experience of coffee beans designed for espresso is that they tend to be a blend of a couple of types of coffee beans. I'll be honest - I have no idea why this is. If I had to guess? Espresso is really intense - a single bean can have all the flavour up front with nothing to follow, or be too subtle and long to register - so maybe a mix of the two creates a good balance. But as I say: I don't really know, so take that with a pinch of salt :)

## Coffee grinder

The quality of your espresso is really dependent upon the quality of your coffee grinder. 

First of all: buy whole beans and grind them yourself at home, and only grind them when you need to use them. Coffee beans are a food stuff - they're the beans from coffee cherries - and will go stale eventually. This takes ages as coffee beans - you've got several weeks - but takes just hours once they're ground. So grinding your own beans, just in time to make your espresso, makes such a positive difference to the taste of the finished drink.

I started out with a [DeLonghi grinder](https://www.delonghi.com/en-gb/products/coffee/coffee-makers/grinders/kg79-0177111028) in the £40-£50 price range. DeLonghi is an Italian company so it makes sense that their grinder works well for dark-roasted coffee beans. However, I could never get it to work consistently well for medium or light roasts and eventually I upgraded to a [Sage Grinder](https://www.sageappliances.com/uk/en/products/coffee/bcg820.html) in the £150-£200 - I'd been making espresso for years by this point so was sure that I'd get a lot of use for it, but it still felt like a lot of money to spend on a coffee grinder. My anxiety eased upon use, however, as the coffee beans I'd had iffy results from in the past suddenly tasted amazing - the ability to fune tune settings made a massive difference. You're unlikely to be able to spend less than £40-£50 on a grinder if you want to make your own espresso at home but can get decent results from this price range if you tactically choose the right coffee beans - but investing at least £150-£200 in a grinder will open up way more options.

Broadly speaking, I'm looking to tweak the settings of my grinder to help get to the flavour of the beans - and the exact settings very bean to bean, and crop to crop. At its simplest, I'm often thinking: ok, if this tastes weak or watery then maybe the coffee has been ground too large and the water is running through it too quickly so I need to grind it a little finer and start again; or maybe the espresso tastes bitter because the coffee beans are ground to fine, the water is sitting in the coffee grinders for too long and over-extracting the coffee, so I need to grind a little coarser. 

Using the [Sage Grinder](https://www.sageappliances.com/uk/en/products/coffee/bcg820.html) to grind the [Square Mile Coffee](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/), I'm often grinding to a setting of '10'.
