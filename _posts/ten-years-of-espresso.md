I was rencently throwing out some old receipts and was suprised to find that I bought my first espresso machine eight years ago - it made me realise that I've come a long way since those first bitter, watery attempts back when the UK was starting prepartion to host the Olympics. Here's what I've learned in that time about making espresso at home: what to buy, and how to use it.

## Why espresso?

There are loads of reasons why [you shouldn't bother making your own espresso at home](https://scottcolfer.com/coffee/2017/12/24/manual-espresso-at-home.html) but for me it's my go-to type of coffee. Espresso is thicker and has more concentrated falvours than most other types of coffee, and you can drink a couple of them because they contain less caffeine than other types of coffee (caffeine is more concentrated in espresso than other coffees but the overall small volume means there's less caffeine in total. I also enjoy the simple fact that I can make decent espresso at home - it's something that lots of people don't have the kit, the patience, or the practice to do - so I take pleasure in making it and friends enjoy the novelty of drinking it. 

## Coffee beans

Coffee beans have different flavours based on a bunch of factors like where they're grown, how they grown, how the flesh of the coffee cherry is removed from the coffee bean, and how the coffee beans are roasted - the 'perfect' coffee is the one you most enjoy. The factor that's often had the most impact on what coffee I enjoy (and the kit I need to make my espresso) is how the coffee is roasted. I was at [Spa Terminus](https://spa-terminus.co.uk/) in London a few years back and got talking about coffee roasting with a coffee roaster called  [Jack Coleman](https://twitter.com/ColemanCoffee) - I'd just had a go at roasting my own coffee and the results had been rubbish. One of the things that Jack explained to me was that coffee has two 'cracks' when it's roasted: the first 'crack' denotes the first point at which you'll get drinkable coffee - before this point the coffee beans remain green and produce undrinkable coffee; the second 'crack' denotes the last point at which you'll get drinkable coffee - after this point you've got burned coffee beans and the coffee will taste like ash. This is the scale for coffee roasting - first crack is the lightest roast possible - second crack is the darkest roast possible. The 'Italian' style coffee beans we get in the UK tend to be towards the darker end of the scale, where you're tasting the roasting process along with the taste of the bean itself (this is why it can taste bitter, and why Italian-style espresso sometimes benefits from sugar) - in my experience, this helps to produce a more consistent coffee bean - and seems to be what the entry-level home expresso kit can handle pretty well. However, my natural preference is for the ligther coffee beans where I can taste more of the bean itself and more of the natural sweetness of the coffee cherry - I never need to add sugar to this type of espresso. In my experience, the downside to light roasts and some medium roasts is that they're less consistent and there's more of a need to fine-tune my espresso kit to get decent results - somethings that's not possible with the cheapest, most entry-level kit.

I've had a few favourite roasters over the years - [Nude Espresso](https://www.nudeespresso.com/), [Monmouth Coffee](https://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/), [Workshop Coffee](https://workshopcoffee.com/), [Allpress](https://uk.allpressespresso.com/) - but what they've got in commmon (other than selling really nice medium/light roasted espresso beans) is that they were in some way local to me at the time of buying - either near to my home, or on the way to work. We're spoiled for good coffee roasters in the UK and in lots of towns and cities there are excellent coffee roasters within a few miles. I currently drink [Square Mile Coffee](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/)'s espresso blends - the coffee beans are excellent - the roastery started in Hackney (my home borough of London) - and it's stocked in my local coffee shop, 46b Espresso Hut, so I can easily buy it when I need it. 

My experience of coffee beans designed for espresso is that they tend to be a blend of a couple of types of coffee beans. I'll be honest - I have no idea why this is. If I had to guess? Espresso is really intense - a single bean can have all the flavour up front with nothing to follow, or be too subtle and long to register - so maybe a mix of the two creates a good balance. But as I say: I don't really know, so take that with a pinch of salt :)

## Coffee grinder

The quality of your espresso is really dependent upon the quality of your coffee grinder. 

First of all: buy whole beans and grind them yourself at home, and only grind them when you need to use them. Coffee beans are a food stuff - they're the beans from coffee cherries - and will go stale eventually. This takes ages as coffee beans - you've got several weeks - but takes just hours once they're ground. So grinding your own beans, just in time to make your espresso, makes such a positive difference to the taste of the finished drink.

I started out with a [DeLonghi grinder](https://www.delonghi.com/en-gb/products/coffee/coffee-makers/grinders/kg79-0177111028) in the £40-£50 price range. DeLonghi is an Italian company so it makes sense that their grinder works well for dark-roasted coffee beans. However, I could never get it to work consistently well for medium or light roasts and eventually I upgraded to a [Sage Grinder](https://www.sageappliances.com/uk/en/products/coffee/bcg820.html) in the £150-£200 - I'd been making espresso for years by this point so was sure that I'd get a lot of use for it, but it still felt like a lot of money to spend on a coffee grinder. My anxiety eased upon use, however, as the coffee beans I'd had iffy results from in the past suddenly tasted amazing - the ability to fune tune settings made a massive difference. You're unlikely to be able to spend less than £40-£50 on a grinder if you want to make your own espresso at home but can get decent results from this price range if you tactically choose the right coffee beans - but investing at least £150-£200 in a grinder will open up way more options.

Broadly speaking, I'm looking to tweak the settings of my grinder to help get to the flavour of the beans - and the exact settings very bean to bean, and crop to crop. At its simplest, I'm often thinking: ok, if this tastes weak or watery then maybe the coffee has been ground too large and the water is running through it too quickly so I need to grind it a little finer and start again; or maybe the espresso tastes bitter because the coffee beans are ground to fine, the water is sitting in the coffee grinders for too long and over-extracting the coffee, so I need to grind a little coarser. 

**Tip to get you started:** Using the [Sage Grinder](https://www.sageappliances.com/uk/en/products/coffee/bcg820.html) to grind the [Square Mile Coffee](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/), I'm often grinding to a setting of '10'.  

## Water

Espresso only has two ingredients - coffee and water - with water being the main ingredient by far, so it's worth making sure it's decent water. What makes decent water? In my experience, it's how well the water allows the coffee to dissolve into it. I live in London which has 'hard water' - which means that it already has lots of solids dissolved in it (hence looking chalky) and is not great at absorbing additional solids, like coffee. A water filter is a great investment if you live in a city like London, since it will remove some of the solids in the water, increase the amount of coffee solids it can absorb, and improve the flavour of the espresso. Using filtered water also has the benefit of reducing the speed with which limescale builds up in your espresso machine, reducing the amount of services it needs and extending its lifespan.

## Espresso machine

So you've got 3 main options when choosing an espresso machine: manual, semi-automatic, or automatic. 

A [manual espresso machine](https://www.lapavoni.com/en/product/europiccola-en/) has a lever that you manually pull down in order to get a shot of espresso - hence the phrase 'pulling a shot of espresso'. I have never met someone who has manual espresso machine. They look cool and there's a certain charm to how basic they are but the videos I've watched suggest there's a **lot** of skill and effort required to get even decent results, and the machines have real limitations to what you can do with them.

At the other end of the scale there are [automatic espresso machines](https://www.gaggia.com/automatic-machines/brera/) that do pretty much everything for you - you pour in water, coffee beans (and milk, if wanted), press a button, and it does the rest. These are great if you want consistently decent espresso without any effort - and trust me, this is not to be sniffed-at - but you're unable to fine-tune the kit to get the best from specific coffee beans so the best you can get is 'decent and consistent' (which, once again, is not to be sniffed at).
Nespresso machines are an extreme type of automatic espresso machine - I'd assume they're business model is that they can subsidise selling the machines at a loss by locking you in to over-priced coffee capsules for the lifetime of the product.

I've got a semi-automatic espresso machine, which means that I don't have to manually pully down a lever (the machine pushes the water through at pressure on my behalf) but I do need to grind, measure, and press (or 'tamp') the coffee grinds myself and time the shot myself (and foam milk myself if wanted). This takes skill and practice - there's no way around this and it would be dishonest to pretend otherwise. It took me a few months to start getting decent results, following a couple of lessons - and I don't think I was getting really good results (on a par with some coffee shops) for a year or so. If you don't have the time or interest to learn a new skill and practice that skill then a semi-automatic espresso machine is a bad choice and I'd suggest an automatic espresso machine instead.

My first espresso machine was a [DeLonghi Icona](https://www.delonghi.com/en-gb/products/coffee/coffee-makers/pump-espresso/icona-vintage-ecov-311bg-0132106117) which can often be picked-up for around £100 on Amazon. This was a great way to learn and pracice without spending lots of money whilst I was still learnig the basics. Eventuall I hit the limits of the machine and upgraded to a [Gaggia Classic](https://www.gaggiadirect.com/gaggia-classic.html#!/Gaggia-Classic-2019-SB-SS-240V-Manual-Espresso-Coffee-Machine/p/125690126/category=21707276). I got mine for £180 in 2012 but oddly they've gone up in price and now seem to cost £200-£300. I think that automatic espresso machines have become the market leader in the last ten years, possibly because of the popularity of capsule espresso machines, and semi-automatic machines are more of a nice market. Whatever the reason, there's not a massive range of decent semi-automatic espresso machines below £1,000. If you don't like the look of the Gaggia Classic then the main alternative seems to remain the [Rancilio Silvia](https://www.ranciliogroup.com/1-Rancilio-Homeline--Silvia) that can sometimes be found in the £500-£600  price range.

One of the reasons I like the Gaggia Classic is that it's got a [portafiler](https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/650x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/r/o/rocket_double_portafilter.jpg) that's 58mm in size - the same size that you'll find in the commercial machines you might find in a coffee shop - which means it's relatively easy to get spares, replacements, and modifications. The Gaggia Classic I bought shipped as standard with a shallow poratfilter [basket](https://caffeforte.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/E/P/EPS_pod.basket.insert_7.jpg) (the thing that holds the coffee grinds) which only allows you to make a single espresso bought I was able to buy a new, deeper basket capable of holding more than enough coffee grinds to produce a double espresso for £5-£10.

I treated myself to a new portafilter a year ago - a '[bottomless portafiler](https://www.coffeehit.co.uk/gaggia-bottomless-portafilter.html)' which doesn't have spouts, for £35. The practical purpose is that is creates more space underneath the portafilter to make it easier to move my espresso cupes in and out whilst creating espresso shots - helpful for me because I rest the espresso cup on small digital scales in order to measure the weight of my shot. An unexpected bonus is that it makes it easier to see how well the espresso is flowing from the machine.

Eventually your Gaggia Classic will get clogged-up to the point that it requires you to service it - in my case it took 5-6 years. When this happened I was able to find a bunch of excellent, helpful vidoes online that told me what to do - this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rX6BvkUM0Y&index=14&t=1s&list=WL) is the one I used most - and just required a special kind of cleaning basket + cleaning powder that I got for £10-£20 from [Doppio](https://doppiocoffee.co.uk/).

## Acccessories

There's some other bits that I use every time I make espresso. I use standard [digital kitchen scales](http://www.salterhousewares.co.uk/salter-disc-electronic-digital-kitchen-scales-black.html) to make sure that I start with the right amount of ground coffee - I zero the scales with the empty portafilter + basket, grind the coffee diretly into the basket and portafilter, then weigh again to check I've got the right amount (I often brew my espresso with 18g-19g ground coffee, depending on the beans I'm using). I've also got [micro scales](http://www.salterhousewares.co.uk/salter-precision-mini-digital-kitchen-scales.html) that I use to measure the weight of the espresso as I'm making it - I zero the scales with the espresso cup on them and normally pour the espresso until I have a double-shot of about 28g-30g (depending on the coffee) - there's normally around and extrate 3g-5g of weight by the time the flow has stopped. The microscales means that they'll actually fit in the small space under the portafilter.

The espresso cups I favour tend to be on the shorter end of the scale so that they're easier to get in and out of the machine (versus taller ones, which can catch on the portafilter). My current favourites are these from [Kaffeeform], made from discarded coffee grounds. 

Finally, a [coffee tamper](https://www.coffeehit.co.uk/rhinowares-barista-tamper-58mm.html) is critical in order to compress the coffee grinds and create a flat, even surface (both so that water doesn't pass through the coffee grinds too quickly, or pass unevenly through the coffee grinds), and a [knockbox](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Coffee-Machine-Cleaning-Products/Grindenstein-Knock-Out-Box-Black/B0016J7YQM/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1550264711&sr=8-4&keywords=coffee+knockbox) is really helpful for emptying out the used coffee grinds - before having one of these I kept accidentally dumping the basket into the bin.

## How do I actually make the espresso?

Using my Sage Grinder to grind Square Mile espresso beans, I will normally use grind setting '10' and set the timer to grind for 15.4-15.6 seconds, which will normally produce approx. 18g of coffee grinds. I'll tamp with a medium firmness, then run the espresso machine until I've got 28g-30g, stopping, and expect a further 3g-5g to come out as the flow stops. This isn't the 'perfect' espresso, it's what gets results that fit my tastes using the beans and kit I own. 

## Milk

I often like to have milk with my espresso and frequently make myself a flat white at the weekend. The steam wand that ships with the Gaggia Classic is **bad** - if you want to steam milk with any kind of decent results then you'll need to replace it with a better steam wand from a different machine. Once again, Youtube came to the rescue - I found and used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWoNXAq2Kus&t=49s), and replaced it with a spare Rancilio Silvia steam wand that I bought for £20-£30 (I think). Be warned though: this type of modification will void your warranty, if you break something then it's up to you to fix it (or to pay for it to be fixed).

As a side note: if you want to use vegan milk then I've found that [Oatly barista edition](https://www.oatly.com/uk/products/oat-drink-barista-edition) gives the best results whilst being widely available in supermarkets.

## Helpful places

I've been helped a lot over the year by the kindess and insights of strangers, including: [Coffee Forums UK](https://coffeeforums.co.uk/content.php) has great advice on modifying and using espresso machines at home; [Seattle Coffee Gear's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SeattleCoffeeGear) is a great way to find out about kit and see it in action; and [James Hoffman's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ) is a great way to find out about how to make coffee and coffee trends (from one of the people behing Square Mile Coffee).

A couple of classes have helped me over the years too - [the craft and science of esprtesso](https://www.departmentofcoffee.com/shop/coffee-school-the-craft-science-of-espresso) at the Department of Coffee - and the [introduction to espresso and milk](https://workshopcoffee.com/pages/masterclasses) at Workshop coffee.

## Espresso yourself

I think that's it. Eight-years of 'self-taught' trial and error into home-made espresso, guided by the kindess of strangers and a couple of classes from experts, distilled into one long post. I hope it's useful. 

If it's convinced you that espresso is too much like hard work or too expensive to make at home - that'd be a sensible conclusion! My kit would probably cost at least £500-£600 to buy from scratch in one go in 2019, and it realistically takes at least a few months and a lot of practice to get decent results. If that's not for you then you can create amazing coffee much more simply using lower-tech methods - here's my [guide to brewing coffee using French Press, filter, and Aeropress](https://scottcolfer.com/2018/11/17/choosing-coffee-brewer.html).

If it's convinced you that making espresso at home using a semi-automatic machine sounds nice and fun, then join the club :) My Gaggia Classic is seven years old and built like a tank - I'm expecting another five-ten years out of it, and it's nice to understand enough about the machine to get good results from it and to look after it. It's really enjoyable to make espresso as good as you might find in some decent independent coffee shops (and better than most chain coffee shops). If you're willing to put in some time and money, it's a hobby that can give you and your loved ones pleasure every morning.
