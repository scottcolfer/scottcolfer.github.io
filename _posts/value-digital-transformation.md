title: "Where's the value in digital transformation?"

Value is the most critical aspects of working with agility. It's the focus of the first of the [principles behind the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). If we were to tweak the Agile Manifesto for Software Development so that it works better as am [Agile Manifesto for Public Services](https://scottcolfer.com/2017/06/03/agile-manifesto-public-services.html) then the first principle would be that:
> Our highest priority is to satisfy the public through the early and continuous delivery of valuable public services.
This is great! 'Digital transformation' which is about helping organisations to work with agility, and focussing on value is one of the most important aspects of working with agility, so we just need to go ahead and do that!

Except that the Agile Manifesto gives us nothing to help figure out what value is. Subsequent frameworks like [Scrum](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) also neglect to help us figure out what value is. Most guides seem to assume that 'value' is figured out somewhere else by 'the business' then presented to delivery teams in a fully-formed stated to be consumed and acted upon. In reality, it's often the case that 'the business' is waiting for delivery teams to present their defintion of value. And so we can end up in a space where we're all delivering 'stuff' early and often without an honest sense of whether it's truly valuable.

Working with agility makes the promise of focussing on value but then witholds the means by which to define value. This is a trickey state of affairs for a product manager because our focus is on managing value: we are responsible for the outcomes of our products and services. It's the role of the product manager to define the value of their products and services - so that's what I'm going to try and do :)

The main principle I need to remember is that **value is context specific**. Trying to define 'value' in the abstract is a fool's errand. I work on public services within the Civil Service as a 'digital' specialist, so this is my context.

## Public value

Value in a commercial setting is quite commonly understood. When the context is 'private value', we're all familiar with measuring value through things like profits or return to shareholders. The Civil Service is not a commercial setting so profit or return to shareholders are pretty usefuless ways of measuring our value. Our goal is satisfy the public's needs through public services, so **our context is [public value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_value)**. 

How do we measure public value? Public value is defined as two things in the context of public service delivery by the Civil  Service:

- mission value: achieving the mission of your department as well as possible whilst hitting financial targets for liquidity
- political value: maintaining the trust of the public in Government 

### Mission value

Financial objective of non-profits: aim for liquidity - maximise the value of their available budget to accomplish their mission

Justice is the basis of democracy. Everyone should be equal in the eyes of the law.

### Political value

Relating to the government, the conduct of government, and the making of government policy.

What everyone gets wrong about stakeholder https://melissaperri.com/blog/stakeholders Stakeholders have specific influence and knowledge that can help your product.

Political needs may not have been clearly expressed to us, and may be disclosed by our bureaucratic rules.

“When an agile team self organises to meet business needs and deliver business value, it cannot just consider customer and user needs for its products. It must consider all of the needs of the organisation and all of the things the business values, and then self organise to meet all of those needs. The needs disclosed by bureaucratic rules are amongst those needs.”

Let’s look at those needs in government.

“Bureaucracy delivers business value.”
‘the public’ (us) pays taxes which we invest in public services on their (our) behalf
deliver public value rather than private value
unique in that we have the authority to compel behaviour . . . but here we must consider, are we compelling behaviour because it makes the act of governing easier, or because it improves the value of public services . . . and we should consider the cost of non-compliance, and the magnitude of punishment for non-compliance when we compel behaviour (is there a cost to the public, e.g. fines or loss of freedom? is there a cost to government, e.g. cost of accommodating people in prison?) 
often there is no competitor; ‘competitor’ is not to get help and do it yourself
government value fairness (procurement, recruitment, etc)
transparency (time, cost, etc) and public accountability . . . “You find that the government is always in the public eye - the press is always reporting on government actions, and the public is quick to outrage [. . .] [so] government places a high value on transparency. While companies can keep secrets, government is accountable to the public and must disclose its actions and decisions. There is a business need for continued demonstrations of trustworthiness, or we might as well say a business value assigned to demonstrating trustworthiness.”
blame is quickly assigned within public services so government is highly risk averse, placing high business value on things that mitigate risk
the above values are needs of government and may sometimes contradict the value of a specific public service
‘mission’ value (e.g. departmental goals)
good ‘customer service’


### Mission value should outweigh political value

At least 51% of value should be focussed on mission. Link to humane product management post.

- section 5 (Ministers and Civil Servants) page 12 "Ministers must uphold the political impartiality of the Civil  Service,  and  not  ask  civil  servants  to  act  in  any  way which  would  conflict  with  the Civil  Service  Code"

Don't get lost in all of this.
Remember that value of users is primary. Need to meet needs of everyone. Accessibility. Assistance.

This is an important point. It's easy to get lost in government. Show how org value contexts are sometimes more complicated than those of our users. Run the risk that it takes more time and effort to meet the needs of the contexts of the government & the civil service than it does to meet the needs of our users.

## Product Manager

"The concept of the product owner's role makes all the more sense now that we have come to think of a business as a type of Complex Adaptive System (CAS). A CAS is a self-organising system with non-linearities and complex interactions, one in which leadership can influence, but not control, outcomes. An important function of leadership in a CAS is to provide context and incentives that nudge the system towards the desired outcomes. In John Henry Clippinger III's book 'The Biology of Business', a business organisation is presented as a Darwinian universe in which leaders and managers can set parameters that determine what ideas and behaviours are most likely to survive: 'Management cannot, and need not, have perfect information; the challenge of management is to create the conditions and contexts that select for a range of desired outcomes as in the processes of natural selection.'" p.??

"The role of leadership and management in a CAS is to influence the evolutionary process so that the organisation delivers on its goals. Leaders create the language of the organisation; they set up incentives and define value in a way that elicits the descired outcomes. They define what it *valued* in order to deliver on the organisation's mission." p.88
