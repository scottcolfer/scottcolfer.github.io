Value is the most critical aspects of working with agility. It's the focus of the first of the [principles behind the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). If we were to tweak the Agile Manifesto for Software Development so that it works better as am [Agile Manifesto for Public Services](https://scottcolfer.com/2017/06/03/agile-manifesto-public-services.html) then the first principle would be that:
> Our highest priority is to satisfy the public through the early and continuous delivery of valuable public services.

This is great! 'Digital transformation' which is about helping organisations to work with agility, and focussing on value is one of the most important aspects of working with agility, so we just need to go ahead and do that!

Except that the Agile Manifesto gives us nothing to help figure out what value is. Subsequent frameworks like [Scrum](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) also neglect to help us figure out what value is. Most guides seem to assume that 'value' is figured out somewhere else by 'the business' then presented to delivery teams in a fully-formed stated to be consumed and acted upon. In reality, it's often the case that 'the business' is waiting for delivery teams to present their defintion of value. And so we can end up in a space where we're all delivering 'stuff' early and often without an honest sense of whether it's truly valuable.

Working with agility makes the promise of focussing on value but then witholds the means by which to define value. This is a trickey state of affairs for a product manager because our focus is on managing value: we are responsible for the outcomes of our products and services. It's the role of the product manager to define the value of their products and services - so that's what I'm going to try and do :)

> "Leaders create the language of the organisation; they set up incentives and define value in a way that elicits the descired outcomes. They define what it *valued* in order to deliver on the organisation's mission." ***The Art of Business Value**,  Mark Schwartz* 

The main principle I need to remember is that **value is context specific**. Trying to define 'value' in the abstract is a fool's errand. I work on public services within the Civil Service as a 'digital' specialist, so this is my context.

## Public value

Value in a commercial setting is quite commonly understood. When the context is 'private value', we're all familiar with measuring value through things like profits or return to shareholders. The Civil Service is not a commercial setting so profit or return to shareholders are pretty usefuless ways of measuring our value. Our goal is satisfy the public's needs through public services, so **our context is [public value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_value)**. 

How do we measure public value? Public value is defined as two things in the context of public service delivery by the Civil  Service:

- **mission value**: achieving the mission of your department as well as possible whilst hitting financial targets for liquidity
- **political value**: maintaining the trust of the public in Government 

### Mission value

Non-profits measure their value through the extent to which they achieve their mission whilst also meeting financial targets for liquidity. 
In practice this means doing as much as possible towards their mission within their budget, and trying to increase their budget if they can see the need to do so.

Mission value usefully describes the main priority for everyone in the Civil Service: our main goal is to achieve our mission as well as possible whilst also meeting financial targets for liquidity. Every Department in Government has a different mission, and its important for each Department to specific how the success of their mission will be measured. What's our one metric that matters (this might change from reporting period to reporting period but it's important to have one at all times)? What are our other key performance indicators? What's the benchmark for these metrics at the beginning of the financial year? By how much do we need to improve them by the end of the financial year in order to justify the investment that the public has made in our mission? How do we know if we've succeeded or failed?

### Political value

Things aren't as simple as that because these public services are delivered through Government. I'm privileged to live in a [liberal democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy) with a [parliamentary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system). We also have a [constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy). These social systems are the social bedrock of our society and critical for our country to continue to run as it does. This means that it's important to maintain the trust of the public in these social systems, something that we define as **political value**. 

Political value may not be clearly expressed to us but is often disclosed by bureaucratic rules. 

> "You find that the government is always in the public eye - the press is always reporting on government actions, and the public is quick to outrage [. . .] [so] government places a high value on transparency. While companies can keep secrets, government is accountable to the public and must disclose its actions and decisions. There is a business need for continued demonstrations of trustworthiness, or we might as well say a business value assigned to demonstrating trustworthiness [. . .] Blame is quickly assigned within public services so government is highly risk averse, placing high business value on things that mitigate risk." ***The Art of Business Value**,  Mark Schwartz* 

**Good bureaucracy** helps maintain the trust of the public in our critical social system and so delivers value. 

> “When an agile team self organises to meet business needs and deliver business value, it cannot just consider customer and user needs for its products. It must consider all of the needs of the organisation and all of the things the business values, and then self organise to meet all of those needs. The needs disclosed by bureaucratic rules are amongst those needs.” ***The Art of Business Value**,  Mark Schwartz* 

### Mission value should outweigh political value

It can sometimes feel as though policitcal value can contradict mission value. How can we test if this is the case, particularly since political value may not be clearly expressed? The answer is not to get lost. The needs of the public remain paramount and the majority of public value should always come from mission value. We have things like the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code) to help guide us, and remind us that we must have integrity, honesty, objectivity, and impartiality. Although it is true that civil servants are accountable to ministers, ministers have their own [code](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/672633/2018-01-08_MINISTERIAL_CODE_JANUARY_2018__FINAL___3_.pdf) which stresses that, "Ministers must uphold the political impartiality of the Civil  Service,  and  not  ask  civil  servants  to  act  in  any  way which  would  conflict  with  the Civil  Service  Code."

The needs of the public should always be the main focus of our work. We should be able to objectively say that at least 51% of the value of our work is defined by how well we are meeting our mission for the public. We should also acknowledge that maintaining the trust of the public in our core social systems is valuable and a worthwhile endevour. We can always check-in with ourselves and ask the simple question: [are we doing good?](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2019/01/lets-resolve-to-create-humane-products-in-2019/) 

## The public value chain

OK, so we've set the context for ourselves: public value. But nothing seems very measurable yet. Not very [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm). Let's see if we can improve that.

First a reminder: value is context specific:
> “Value” is the most ambiguous word in business. It means something different to every person that says it, primarily based on where they’re positioned in an organisation. ***[Defining value: the most ambiguous word in product development](https://medium.com/swlh/defining-value-the-most-ambiguous-word-in-product-development-3c36af377ecd)**, Jeff Gothelf*

I work on public services within the Civil Service as a 'digital' specialist, so this is the perspective for which is want to define value. This requires me to locate the small bit of public services in which I play a part.

It's possible to view public services as operating at [three levels](https://scottcolfer.com/2018/05/14/public-service.html):

**Public service** |  
--- |
**1. End-to-end public service**: A service helps a user to do something that needs to be done, and completely meets that need. It also helps government achieve policy intent on behalf of its citizens with whom it has a social contract. Services are best identified as verbs (visit the UK), rather than nouns (biometric residence permit).  |
**2. Features of services**: this is ofen where we (digital) work. Often the things we work on are just one step in a service, like 'applying for a visa' - a software feature of a larger, end-to-end service |
**3. Capabilities of features**: these are the resources required to run the features of services. Examples include people, specialist tools, technology, and data. |

Each level is critically dependent upon the others in order to provide an end-to-end public service since all are required for the overall value of an end-to-end public service. These three levels are the main links in the value chain for public services.

**Public service** | **Value chain** 
--- | --- 
**End-to-end service** e.g. 'visit the UK'  | **Impact** e.g. number of peope who visit the country legally increases
**Features of services** e.g. 'apply for a visa to visit the UK' | **Outcomes** e.g. time taken to successfully apply for a visa decreases
**Capabilities for features** e.g. 'digitisation' project team | **Outputs** e.g. visa application process is 'digitised'

*It's possible for the links in a value chain to become invisble or even break all together. A [logic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_model) can help to restore a value chain when this happens. [Theory of change](https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/overview/models-for-community-health-and-development/logic-model-development/main) are the most common type of logic model used in situations such as these but aren't without [criticism](https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/whats-wrong-with-theories-of-change/), with system-mapping tools like [Wardley Mapping](https://www.cio.co.uk/it-strategy/introduction-wardley-value-chain-mapping-3604565/) increasingly used to map out value chains.*

From my perspective working witin a 'digital' team in the Civil Service, I'm typically working on the software features of end-to-end services - looking at the above value chain, we can see that value in this context is defined by the outcomes of that software has for the users of the software: measurable changes in user behaviour that contribute towards the overall impact that our Department would like to have.

## The value of digital transformation is currently measured by the outcomes of software

OK, we've taken a long journey and arrived at a conclusion. Value from my perspective is likely to mean the outcomes of the software features of end-to-end public services, measured through changes in user behaviour that contribute towards the overall impact that our Deparment would like to have. 

### Value of staff software

For my own organisation, the majority of our portfolio can be described as 'staff services': software for our colleagues to help them do their jobs. This is broadly described by the term '[business to business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business)' software. 

It's possible to say that busines to business software meet three main needs:

**Doing daily admin** | **Making decisions** | **Complying with bureaucracy**
--- | --- | --- 

We can measure the extent to which these needs are being met through measures like:

**Time taken** | **Capacity** | **Failure demand**
--- | --- | --- 

Test out the above with your most challenging staff services, where we're often told that it's difficult to measure value. 

Let's take hosting or infrastructure. We often consider hosting or infrastructure platforms to be 'technical', and may even hire 'technical' product managers. In reality, hosting and infrastructure are capabilities, they are 'outputs'. They are actually platforms to help run and change software. The outcome of a good platform for developers is things like: certificate management (daily admin), testing software iterations before publishing (making decisions), and maintaining the security of data (complying with bureacracy). All of these can be measured through 'time taken' (which might be measured through number of steps required). All can be measured through failure demand (e.g.  incidents). And improving any or all of them can improve the capacity of an organisation to make changes within fixed resources. 

As a starting point, the above needs and measures could help us to create a common language for defining the value of staff services in the Civil Service

*The [video](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2018/11/driving-growth-vs-building-core-value-by-roan-lavery/) of Roan Lavery's talk at Mind the Product 2018 is a great place to explore value in a B2B context in more depth.*

### Value of public software

My own organisation also has a significant amount of public-facing software. I find this harder to desribe in quite so simple terms as those used for staff services. So I need to go very general as a starting point.

Very broadly speaking, I think that the most common public-facing software in my organisation and across the Civil Service is 'apply for a thing': a webform that allows a member of the public to apply for a public service. Talking about value is tricky here, as it's arguable that application forms to meet a true user need, since very few users ever say 'I really want to have to complete an application form before accessing a service that I believe I'm entitled to'. Government has a need to check that the publis is genuinely entitled to public services they wish to access and this is the main need being met. The user need is probably something like 'make the application process as simple as possible, with as little 'friction' as possible'. The Service Standard's [manadatory KPIs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/identify-performance-indicators) provide a good way of measuring how well these needs are being met:

**Completion rate** | **User satisfaction** | **Cost per transaction** | **Adoption**
--- | --- | --- | ---

In  fact, we could take this further and start measuring a single score worked out something like the following:

**User Value Score = {Adoption*(Completion rate + User Satisfaction)}/Cost per application**

This could work at multiple levels. E.g. For an individual online application form, adoption is the % of people who use the online option.
At Department level, adoption is the total number of people who apply for services online (which will be inhibted until forms are digitised). At Government level, adoption is the number of people who apply for services online (which, once again, will be inhibted until forms are digitised).

OK, this is great! We now have a way of measuring the value of staff services, and it's possible to create a single score to measure the value of public-facing services! Well yes . . . but value takes time . . . and time is another thing that's been missing from digital transformation.
