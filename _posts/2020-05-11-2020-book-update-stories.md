# One. The Moth

_No one wants to speak. The organisers are walking the rows, hustling the audience for storytellers. Because the audience are also the act. Five people must agree to tell a true, personal story for the night to proceed. The month is February and the theme is ‘love hurts’. The host provides encouragement as the room fills up and a nervous energy builds. People grab drinks from the bar before things start, assuming things will kick-off . . . One by one, five people sign-up to tell a personal story of love to a room of strangers. The stories are intimate, surprising, rough around the edges, and brilliant._

[Moth Club](https://themoth.org/) takes place monthly-ish around the world, with a [regular slot](https://themoth.org/events/results?eventLocations=67&typesOfEvents=&eventDate=) at the Rich Mix in East London. A host, a location, and a theme are provided but members of the audience provide the entertainment. Moth Club is a celebration of storytelling in its purest and simplest: entertaining people by taking something that’s taking a true, personal story and spinning it into a yarn. It’s also a chance to get immediate feedback on a story. If you’re writing a short story and want to improve it, there’s no better way to do this than reading it out loud to people and seeing their reaction. That’s the lesson that I’m going to take from Moth Club when writing my book.

I’ve got a baby, I’m back at work, and we’re in lock down. I’m not going to do a lot of writing for the next couple of months, and I’m not going to put myself under pressure to do so. But writing my book is the last and the smallest aspect of creating my book. I can share my ideas out loud, see the reaction, and improve them before I document them in the book. I’ve helped people with their own writing. They often want a chance to talk about their ideas out loud, and for me to listen to them and share what I took from them. I’ll try the same thing for myself. Right now, making time to speak with like minded people sounds pretty good. The moral here is that I can improve my writing by 'putting down the pen' and telling tales directly to others.
