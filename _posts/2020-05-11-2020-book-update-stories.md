# One. The Moth

No one wants to speak. The organisers are walking the rows, hustling the audience for storytellers. Because the audience are also the act. Five people must agree to tell a true, personal story for the night to proceed. The month is February and the theme is ‘love hurts’. The host provides encouragement as the room fills up and a nervous energy builds. People grab drinks from the bar before things start, assuming things will kick-off . . . One by one, five people sign-up to tell a personal story of love to a room of strangers. The stories are intimate, surprising, rough around the edges, and brilliant.
