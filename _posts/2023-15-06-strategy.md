The science of strategy - it's a hypothesis - product way of working

Does not come from strategic management model, tool, matrix, triangle. Does come from a talented leader identifying the one or two critical issues in a situation. 

Strip out ambition, leadership, vision, planning, competition. Discover the critical factors in a situation & find a way to coordinate & focus action to deal with those factors. These are all signs of bad strategy. Actively avoids obstacles. Mistakes goal setting for strategy. Spreads recources rather than focuses them. Having confilicting goals, dedicating recources to unconnected tagets and accomodating incompatible interests. Laundry list of desirable incomes. Absence of saying 'no'.
Cost of decentralisation is loss of coordination across units.
Bad strategy:
- fluff: gibberish. buzz words. masquerades as expertise.
- failure to face the challenge. if the challenge is not defined we can't assess the quality of the strategy
- mistakes goals for strategy
- bad strategic objectives that fail to address issues or are impractical
Bad strategy flourishes because it floats free of analysis, logic or choice.
Template style strategy
- transformational leader
- develops a vision
- inspires people to sacrifice for the good of the organisation
- empowers people to accomplish that vision.
- Vision: popular is 'to be the best' or 'be  the leading' or 'be the best known'
- Mission: fill a high-sounding, politically correct statement of your purpose
- Values: Fill in a statement describing your values. Make sure they are non-controversial.
- Strategy: Fill in some aspirations/goals but call them strategies.

Use 'goals' to express overall values and desires; 'objectives' to deonote specific operational targets

Good strategy involves focus and therefore choice.

A good strategy honestly acknowledges the challenges we face and provides an approach to overcome them.

My note: the opposite of chaos isn't order it's harmony 

Competitive advantage: rich - relatively few residents - AND - starting from scratch 

Doesn't urge us towards goals & visions, it acknowledges our problems & navigates around them
Roadmap - road MAP
Kernel:
Diagnosis
Policy/Theory
Coherent plan: feasible policies, resource commitments and actions

What has to happen for this dream to become reality?
Find our best opportunities - our biggest problems - opportunity solution tree

Competitive advantage versus suppliers
Better at Disco
Can influence org, e.g. standards 

Good strategy is scientific. It is a hypothesis. We need a safe space to test those hypotheses.

What's your actual goal? Let's write a list. What's top?

Good strategy requires good knowledge of the specifics. There's no substitute for on the ground experience.

Example: YDtv
Deficit model
excluded from policy and service design
turn weakness in to strength
Didn't try and improve them, connected them then let them do their own thing

Example: Cloud Platform
If you decentralise you lose coordination

If you rearrange a logic model you get a business model - the thing it adds is impact

For strategy article - being independent thinker - avoid being cumudgeonly - tenth man / third person

Gov.uk - commodity - is what it's becoming - that's a problem & an opportunity

Policy - is a method - like a recipe
Baking
