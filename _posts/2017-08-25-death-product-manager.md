The birth of the user must be at the cost of the death of the product manager.
(Roland Barthes)

Identity Crisis - 2017 - what’s the deal?

You are not the CEO

We don’t (usually) Manage products

A product is something you use and own, like soap.
A service is something you use but don’t own, like Netflix.
Today, in the age of cloud software, we’re often managing services - so why are we still called Product Managers?

History
‘You’ll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink Camay’

It’s 1931.
Neil McElroy is in charge of promoting the Camay soap brand for Proctor & Gamble. 
Neil is frustrated that Camay always plays second fiddle to P&G’s leading brand, Ivory. 

“In a famous memo to management, he argued for the creation of the role of “brand manager”. This person would take overall responsibility for the commercial success of a product, managing it holistically like a business in its own right.”
- The Practitioner’s Guide to Product Management by Jock Busuttil p.10

P&G agreed, and Neil paved the way for the profession of product management.

Agile and software and scrum, oh my

It’s 2001.
The manifesto for agile software development was created by a group including Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle in February, and then Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle publish Agile Software Development with Scrum’in October (quick work, huh?). In 2002, Schwaber and others found the Scrum Alliance.

The agile manifesto and accompanying principles say that we should seek to maximise the value of software, by prioritising features based on how valuable and delivering them asap. The scrum framework interprets the agile manifesto as a framework for development teams to use, and names product managers as the members of the team who prioritise the features to be developed, based on how valuable they are. The scrum framework also chooses to rebrand product managers as ‘product owners’. 

Neil McElroy’s vision of someone managing a product and running it like a business in its own right has been taken and rebooted for software, by the scrum framework . . . promoting the role of product manager in the process under the banner of ‘product owner’.

Circles and CEOs

It’s 2011.
Communities like ‘Mind the Product’ had emerged by 2010, becoming an international community with over 50,000 members within a few short years.

In https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B008FYYCT8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1 Mark Butje says that product managers are like CEOs . . . ‘powerless CEOs’. 
“The product manager is a weird person - someone who takes on an enormous amount responsibility without actually being in charge. Sort of like a CEO but without the hierarchic power.” quote

Product Leadership.
Value in the generalist on the team.

Product managers began to strain against the constraints of the scrum framework.
The increasing ubiquity of product management meant that it was being used outside of software development.
Limits of scrum.
Identity crisis. In 2010, it was pretty tricky to usefully explain what you actually did if you were working outside of the scrum framework.

Will scrum be the death of the product manager
https://aimconsulting.com/insights/blog/will-scrum-be-the-death-of-product-management/ 

We look for value in the dark

We agreed that we don’t have Technical Product Managers - change to SME thing.
The time is now.
Product Management has made its way to government.
Limits of scrum.

Vision
Better described as ‘value manager’.
Value strategy.

Value manager also helps our colleagues that we can work in the intangible space known as 'senior leadership’. 'Product’ is a tangible thing and makes our colleague think that 'you don’t need a product manager when there’s no product’. However, 'portfolio’ is just another type of backlog, & all the tricks we’ve learned in development teams work in portfolio teams.

Add description of product manager from value book.
