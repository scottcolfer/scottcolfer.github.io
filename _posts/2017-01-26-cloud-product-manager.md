**Ministry of Justice Digital needs an interim Product Manager for our Cloud Platform to start asap and can offer:** 

- **£450-£550 per day**

## Cloud Platform

The Cloud Platform is a B2B service for the internal government market, providing a hosting, deployment and testing service built on AWS, for developers building in-house software within the justice system. It brings industry-leading tooling and continuous integration to the heart of government.

The Cloud Platform is in Beta phase, increasing its resilience and improving its service wrapper before moving into a growth phase, and needs a Product Manager that can work with the team to increase adoption.

The Ministry of Justice was amongst the first government organisations to make significant use of public cloud hosting and the Cloud Platform has been instrumental in making this change.

## Ministry of Justice Digital

 The MOJ Digital team develops services that improve lives and is looking for product managers who want to solve tough problems. 

Government digital services are a beacon of user centred design. We are looking for product managers who put users first and understand the value of defining problems before developing solutions. This means we need people who understand user research, user experience and design. 

We apply a lean startup mentality at scale and need product managers who can work in areas of extreme uncertainty by working with agility and making data driven decisions within an empowered, co-located software team of specialists including developers, researchers, designers and stakeholders from across the justice system. We have a great culture and modern tools (like Macbooks and Google apps).

We are actively improving the diversity of our workforce in order to get the best talent available. We want our workforce to represent the variety of people in the broad UK population and do not discriminate based on age, sex, pregnancy or family commitments, disability, race or religion.

Life’s too short not to do something important so join a team with a mission to improve millions of lives.
The products
MOJ Digital has a diverse portfolio of products to suit a wide range of product management skills:

- software for the public like [visit someone in prison](https://www.gov.uk/prison-visits)
