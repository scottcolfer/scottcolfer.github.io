Hey folks, here's a bunch of things I've learned about product management in Government over the years, pulling together and sharing in one place.

[What type of product manager are you?](https://scottcolfer.com/2021/08/16/types-of-product-manager.html). Product management can means different things in different places. That's OK. Just make sure there's a good fit between how the role's being used and what the organisation truly needs from the role.

[What is product management [in Government]?](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/10/03/what-is-product-management-at-the-moj/). This post on the MOJ blog summarises what Government needs from our role and what it looks like along the career pathway. _There's a [longer version](https://scottcolfer.com/2019/01/02/what-is-product-management.html) on my personal blog._

Value: Melissa Perri shared a wine-fuelled [Tweet](https://twitter.com/lissijean/status/1129537047105032194) a couple of years ago saying that product management is about outcomes and value more than technology. I totally agree. Here's my take on why 'product manager' is a bit of a rubbish way of describing our role, tbh, and that [we're really value managers](https://scottcolfer.com/2017/09/17/value-manager.html). To help with this, I did some digging to figure out some high-level principles and guidance on [how to measure the outcomes/value of our products](https://scottcolfer.com/2019/03/20/measuring-value-software.html) (this definition is used for internal Service Assessment at the Ministry of Justice). I worked with a Cabinet Office Economic Analyst in 2018 and contributed to guidance on [measuring product benefits](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-service-benefits).

[Product management handbook](https://scottcolfer.com/product-management-handbook/): I started managing other PMs back in 2015 and found myself repeatedly sharing the same blog posts and books. I started picking-up the Head of Product role in 2016 so pulled together links to these blogs/books together for the profession. 2017 and I got the Head of Product role permanently and decided to switch the links to a handbook with more explanation, and more tweaks to make it relevant for Government. I've updated the handbook yearly since, publishing this open version in 2018. This white label handbook remains a great tool for product managers. And it'd benefit from updates that reflect that last couple of years of developments in the world of product management. The handbook is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/scottcolfer/product-management-handbook) where anyone can contribute.
Here are some individual posts that expand on sections of the handbook:

'Technical' products: I started off at as 'hands-on' product manager, helping to form a Platforms department. I learned a lot here. Two posts about this time are '[The five stages of applying the Service Standard to technical stuff](https://scottcolfer.com/2017/04/26/user-centred-technical-products.html)' and '[5 tips for successful internal platforms](https://scottcolfer.com/2021/09/20/tips-for-internal-platforms.html)'.

Finally, if you're looking to make the move from product management to product leadership then there's '[how I developed as a product leader](https://scottcolfer.com/2019/09/01/product-leadership.html)', '[5 product management hacks for product leaders](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/5-product-management-hacks-for-product-leaders/)', and '[lessons learned from six-years leading a product management community of practice](https://scottcolfer.com/2022/02/06/six-years-community-practice.html)'.
