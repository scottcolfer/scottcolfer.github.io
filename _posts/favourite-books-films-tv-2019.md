# Books and films

I mainly read/watch horror, science fiction, and supernatural. 2019 wasn't necessarily the year they were released or even then first time that I watched/read it - but it was enjoyed this year none the less.

## Books

A lot of anthologies, and a focus on cosmic horror, cyberpunk dystopian sci-fi. Favourites include:

# Videogames

I've now officially given-up on AAA games in 2019, almost exclusively playing indie games. A lot of adventure/exploration. Some surprisingly touching games here, like The Gardens Between, Gris, Night in the Woods, and North.

# Food

Very few fancy restaurants this year, we've been enjoying the same brunch-spots and takeaways as last year. We've been enjoying ramen this year, favourite spots being [Shoryu](https://www.shoryuramen.com/stores/77-westfield-stratford) in Stratford and [Men](http://www.menhackney.com/) on Chatsworth Road.
