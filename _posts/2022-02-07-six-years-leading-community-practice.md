title: "Lessons learned from six-years leading a community of practice"
date: 2022-02-07
---

There are a bunch of blog posts about building professional communities of practice. They’re often from people who help start the community. Or people that come in and support them for a period of time. I’ve not seen many that cover the history of a community over years.

I re-launched the Ministry Of Justice’s product management community of practice in 2016. It started with 10-12 people and, six-years later, it’s approaching 80 people. The same number of people have come and gone during that time. In 2021 I picked-up leadership across the user-centred, product and delivery professions, increasing my scope to 350+ people across 6 specialisms. Now’s a good time to reflect on what I’ve learned. 

This is a post about what it’s like to lead the same community of practice for a long time. It’s the story of what happens as the people change, enthusiasm ebbs and flows and the community grows. Each section could be a post in its own right but I haven’t got the time or patience for that :) So here’s a single, whistle stop  post about what it’s like to be six-years deep in a community of practice.

# Prologue

## It’s ok to start with “the Spotify model” . . . and abandon it

I was hands-on in product management at the MOJ before I became Head of Product. I was responsible for a staff-facing product when I joined in 2015, our ‘Cloud Platform’ for running and changing software. This took (and still takes today) the form of a continuous integration setup built on Amazon Web Services. As part of this I had to centralise the Web Operations Engineers, helping them to switch from a being a lone wolf on each product team to being a centralised profession with consistent tooling and a shared approach to supporting all our software. So obviously I learned about [Spotify’s engineering model](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/) (which subsequently became known as ‘the Spotify model’) and tried to lift it and drop it straight onto our world. Tribes, squads, chapters, guilds. The whole lot. And it didn’t work for us. At all. Spotify described the features of their approach but the benefits, the intent was implicit. So, for a short amount of time, we chased tribes, squads, chapters, guilds and what they meant for us. But without a clear ‘so what’. And then we abandoned it.

It made me feel better when, years later, I found out that [Spotify also abandoned ‘the Spotify model’](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/). 

# Part 1: The Product Management Community

## Learn the key principles of a community and then figure out how to make them work for you

 Skip to 2016 and I’m starting to lead the MOJ’s product management community of practice. I’ve started leading the profession in a sketchy, unofficial way. I still have hands-on responsibilities for product teams. There’s 10-12 folks in product management roles. Majority are contractors. There’s no clear leadership for the profession. There’s a regular meetup for those that want to attend. It’s mainly a place to talk, largely to blow-off steam, until the time is up. The role was sketchily designed and used inconsistently. Anyone could hire a product manager and use them as they wanted. There was no career pathway for permanent product managers.  

Professions as a whole are in a weak place with an outgoing senior leader seeing little value in them. And even less value in heads of profession. A new senior leader joins and sees more value in professions but remains to be convinced.  

'[Building Successful Communities of Practice](https://emilywebber.co.uk/building-successful-communities-of-practice/)' by Emily Webber was released at the beginning of this year. I was already aware of some of the concepts in the book but loads were new. The book was incredibly helpful in framing my thinking and led to lots of action and decisions. Here's what I did and what I learned in when establishing a community of practice.

- **Meeting together is important.** Meetups are a part of the community. At times an important part. But they’re only one part. Trust is crucial and is earned through time together. Trust builds safety And safety promotes constructive challenge and questioning.  
- **. . . but less important that you think.** The most common mistake is to conflate a community of practice with meetups. Everything that follows is as important as meeting together.
- **If knowledge can be made explicit, make it explicit.** A huge part of a community of practice is documenting and sharing knowledge.  You’re not limited to asking someone in person at a meetup. Working in the open means that anyone can find knowledge and use it at any time.
- **Invest in shared role descriptions.** Key skills and expectations of product management can still be unclear in 2022. This was even more so in 2016. We spent several months working on this. Organisations can be reluctant to adopt new things created by their own staff so I joined a cross-government working group defining product management for the whole of Civil Service. I was able to take our thinking and feed it into the working group resulting in something that immediately worked for us at MOJ. As a bonus, it was endorsed by the Cabinet Office. It cam packaged as a cross-government [digital, data and technology capability framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework) linked to unlocking improved pay for digital specialists. This made it much easier to get buy-in for the roles within my own organisation. The [role description](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-manager) improved professional development. It paved the way for much more open and fair recruitment and promotion too. And it helped challenge misconceptions about the role and how it's used.
- **Create a handbook.** 1:1s are a critical feature of a community of practice. I was managing all the PMs and began to spot the same things coming up time and again. I was recommending the same blog posts, books and talks again and again. So I started connecting PMs with the same interests together. And documenting the things I was recommending in a shared space. During the year this bgain as a wiki with a few links to existing posts and books. However loads of the existing stuff was for commercial organisations. Particularly Californian tech startups. It required recontextualisation tweaks to be directly useful in UK public services. So a bunch of Google Docs recontextualising existing stuff developed. By the end of the year we had a single Google Doc called the ‘product management handbook’ that pulled together all the things we most commonly used or needed. Skip ahead a year and we moved it to a Google Site to make it easier to use. A few other Depts asked if they could use it so I put a [version online](https://scottcolfer.com/product-management-handbook/) for others to use. It’s still there, albeit a few versions behind the MOJ one.
- **Define membership.** Something we had to be explicit about was membership. Who’s in the profession? How do we gain entry to the profession? This can be difficult. It can challenge colleagues. Senior colleagues had been able to badge people as ‘product manager’ until this point. Some colleagues had applied the badge to themselves. But it was critical for the integrity of the profession. We had to create and protect a reputation for excellence. And we had to ensure entry to the profession was open and fair (versus ‘tap on the shoulder’).
- **Have some goals.** It was important to have shared goals to build some momentum behind the profession. The bullet-points above give a sense of those early goals. We all wanted a clear and consistent understanding of the role. And we wanted a chance for career progression. These early goals were basic but they built the foundations of the community.
- **It's OK to begin with a single leader.** I avoided leadership for too long. It is possible for a professional community to shared leadership over time. But I’ve never seen an immediate jump to this model work. A professional community needs a traditional, single leader at the beginning. I lacked the confidence and self-awareness to go with this for at least 6 months. It took a while for me to finally pitch myself as a clear leader. And no-one blinked. They trusted me. I’d been doing it anyway. It made things simpler. 

As a result of all this, starting 2017, we were able to cement our role descriptions. The only route into the profession became via open and fair recruitment. Recruitment was led by the profession. It sounds obvious now but we agreed that product managers should be managed by product managers. Until then management could end up provided by anyone. We agreement to open our first permanent, Senior Product Manager campaign. Later that year we would see our first internal promotions. 

Don’t get me wrong, things could still be messy, that’s the reality of change in a large organisation. But we had a much clearer sense of what we were doing, why we were doing it, and how to do it. And a better sense of belonging to a shared profession.

‘If I knew then what I know now’ I could've done things better (and have done since). I was able to hire Emily and we worked together at the beginning of 2017. By this time Emily had introduced indicators of [community maturity](https://emilywebber.co.uk/community-of-practice-maturity-model/). We used it in a new area of the profession. Each indicator of maturity was a card and the PMs did a card sort. They agreed what was ‘done’ and what was ‘in progress’. This gave a sense of the maturity of the profession. What was done and what was in progress. And gave a chance to prioritise what happens next. This was a great way to build-up a 3-6 month backlog of shared community activity. I've used this approach several times since. You can achieve in 1-2 community meetups what it took us a few months to figure out back in 2016. Hiring an expert like Emily was a great opportunity to ask questions, test ideas and gain support. It was also useful to build trust internally about the approach we were taking.

## Psychological safety

I’ve not seen much written about the emotional cost of introducing psychological safety to a community of practice. ‘Psychological safety’ was a buzz-phrase in digital circles for a while, made popular by a post on ‘[the five keys to a successful Google team](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/)’. My take is that we should all feel safe to turn up to work as our true selves without fear of negative consequences. And we should feel safe to be constructively honest and challenging in our interpersonal relationships within groups at work. Organisations that foster this kind of psychological safety typically foster high-performing teams. Google repopularised this around the time we were working on our professional community.

What comes after the successful introduction of psychological safety can be hard. If you introduce psychological safety within a group it can build personal trust in you from individuals within that group. That trust is precious and has to be respected. Every time I’ve setup a community and helped build trust there’s followed a few weeks, sometimes months, of finding out what’s going on in the real lives of people in that group. I’d regularly get messages on Friday afternoon, when folks have a bit of downtime at work, asking to talk about something. And I’d learn what people had been holding onto for months, sometimes years. It could be a work life thing. A real life thing. A combination of both. Often serious stuff. We’re all people and we’ve all got a lot going on that’s often invisible when we only see each other in sporadic, formal meetings. A professional community can leave more space for us to be our true, messy selves. If you’re leading the profession you can become a focal point for this. It’s a sign that things in the community are going well and people are starting to get the space and support they need. But you must be prepared for the responsibility of being in this position. And prepared for the emotional impact of those Friday afternoon chats. Tears at work are more common than you’d think. You’ve got to step-up and help the people in your community - but realise that you can’t do it alone. You are responsible for providing a safe space for something to be shared. But you can’t solve everyone’s problems on your own. You have to get help from your peers. It’s OK to connect someone with a colleague more suited to support them. It’s OK to ask for help in talking-through how to support someone. Make friends with your organisation’s policies, guidance and helplines. They may be buried in the Intranet but I bet they’re more helpful than you realise.

It’s important that your community makes safe space for its members. You might be the person who needs to create this safety. If you are, make sure you’re prepared for those Friday afternoon chats. Think about how to have these conversations. Think about how you step-up and support without trying to be a hero. And without burning yourself out. Make sure you have the same safe space for yourself.

# Head of Profession and being ‘hands-on’

We developed a rule of thumb in our early years. Below five people in a profession and you need one person to do some occasional leadership activity. 5-10 people and you need one person to be 50% on ‘Head of profession stuff’. At some point between 10-20 people you need a full-time Head of Profession.

I learned this the hard way. In 2016 I was managing 10-15 folks. Forming and leading the profession. And ‘hands-on’ in one product team and one discovery. [I nearly burned out](https://scottcolfer.com/2019/09/01/product-leadership.html). But I had senior colleagues who agreed that we needed at full-time Head of Product. and was able to apply for (and get) this role. 

It’s tricky though. There’s a lot of anxiety around no longer being ‘hands-on’ and losing your specialist skills. I was at a conference a few years ago and someone asked me if I was mainly doing people management now I was Head of Product? I said ‘yes’. And that people management was the role of a product manager, right? Product Managers don’t do anything. We listen. Think. And speak. In that order. We listen to the perspectives in our team and find value in the sweet spot where they align. A team is a team is a team. A management team is still a team. As Head of Product I had become the product manager in a management team. I was still creating value propositions, outcome-driven goals and aligning multidisciplinary perspectives. I tweaked my approach a little and to fit a management team. I remained ‘hands-on’ as long as I continually learned and improved and made products more valuable. Leading your profession and designing it to work well at scale is very much delivery. It’s delivering the capability your organisation needs to do its work. By coaching in your specialist skill at large scale. By all means reflect on how you tweak your specialist skills to work at scale within a management team.. But don’t allow yourself to get lost in worry that you’re no longer ‘hands-on’. 

Sharing leadership

So a year or two into the professional community and our organisation grows. A lot. Digital and Technology within one organisation merge. And then merge with Digital and Technology teams in four other organisations. We find ourselves in a new Digital and Technology super-function. We’ve gone from a world of about 100-150 people to a world of over 1,000 people within a year. The community is now spread across several business units and many locations. We have new members and have to restart some of our community building activity. Our profession doubles in size. 

 Until now I've managed everyone. I designed the role descriptions. Designed the job ads and recruitment approach. Chaired all interviews. Made all hires. Onboarded the new folks. 

 I need to share leadership activity with my peers. 

We have our first permanent Senior Product Managers. I'm able to share share meetups, recruitment, 1:1s, coaching and mentoring with them. This feels weird at first. Let’s take recruitment. I’m pretty anxious about relaxing my control of this activity and handing it over to others . . . but it’s fine. It’s more than fine, it’s good - the Senior PMs bringing their perspective and improve it. Sharing leadership activity with me strengthens the profession. We lose a single point of failure/bottleneck (me). And gain diverse leadership of the profession. Each I share leadership of an activity I can introduce a little more strategic activity to my role. I have the headspace to solve the root cause of some of our issues instead of treating the symptoms. You can’t do that if you’re Chairing five simultaneous recruitment campaigns and line managing 15+ people.

Localisation and contextualisation becomes important. We make space for it alongside the original need for process and consistency. 

It’s still important to all meet together as a profession. It's only feasible a couple of time a year. But it's worth the effort to reconnect with each other.  Regular meetings now happen in segments. We develop 2-3 community meetups based on geographical location. I spend the day in each location on the day of the meetup. 

Our shared artefacts keep us connected between big meetups. The handbook, role description, approaches to recruitment and learning become even more important. We introduce separate Slack channels for segments of the profession. But keep our main, shared channel. All are open and accessible by all. Weekly updates give me a chance to share what I learn with everyone. People joining, people leaving, interesting reading, product updates, etc. 

I reposition myself so I represent everyone. I can't embed in the ‘original’ community as this reduces trust in me from the other locations. I give up my permanent desk and become a peripatetic* Head of Product.  

*_I'm allowing myself this one, obscure word. I take 'peripatetic' to mean someone who travels from place to place, working in them for short periods._
