Why I blog

I've been figuring things out for the last couple of years and blog posts have been a critical part of my career development.
This post is intended to summarise and share the reasons that I've found blogging to be so helpful. 

blogged to figure things out for the last couple of years.

## Circumstance

Specifically: what does it mean to move from product management to product leadership?

Leaders lead - that means going first - https://scottcolfer.com/product-management-handbook/ Leadership is a gap

Don't have product leaders above me. I haven't had a more senior product leader above me for 3 years = have had activity managers but little professional coaching

## Action 

Talk about:

- art of business value, took ages to work at it until I'd distilled the aspects that were valuable to me and then contexutalised these for working on public services
- lean enterptrise, took months to have read it; transcribed notes (I took photos of most relevant sections], summarised and re-arranged to form coherent notes, distilled them into something I could work with, and then contextualise for public services - and then still never became a post. It was too large. I have a 5-10 side 'lean government' personal guide that I still work from but in reality it has been used to infuse and create 10-20 practical projects at work rather than becoming an single, abstract piece
- coaching with Georg
- events: product leaders meetup; conference; product supper; heads of product meetups; x-gov product meetups; at least 2 out of 5 days each week are spent working on tough problems with product managers in my profession; speak with other PMs in govt individually and as groups (every time you help someone else to figure out a problem for themselves you hear a fresh way to approach your own problems).

Posts for others that were more about transmission of information or guidance

## Result

I can now articulate what product leadership is - how it's different from product management
I didn't have time for a short letter so I wrote a long one instead

## How I blog

Google Docs (now trialling Calmly) is where I take notes
Notes might sit there for anything up to a year or so; or some make it straight to a post
Some notes will lead to a post, when I want to try and draw some conclusions from it
GitHub

Different types
self-promotion, profile-raising
Transparency, making things open
Sharing tips
