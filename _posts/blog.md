Why I blog

I've blogged to figure things out for the last couple of years.
Specifically: what does it mean to move from product management to product leadership?
Figuring out what it means to me to be a product leader has be tricky and it's taken time.
I didn't have the clarity to write short posts so I've written long ones instead.
