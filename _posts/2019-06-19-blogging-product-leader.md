title: "How blogging helped me become a better product leader"

I’ve been working out how to develop as a product leader for the last few years. Blogging has been a critical tool in my development. This post summarises and shares the reasons I’ve found blogging to be helpful. 

## Context

I needed to work out how to develop as a product leader. Product  leadership is a relatively new concept. There's little guidance out there that's 'ready to go'. 

To be more specific:

- I’ve progressed from product management to product leadership
- There’s some way to go  until product leadership roles are understood and used to their full  potential. ‘Senior Product  Manager’ and ‘Lead Product Manager’ can sometimes mean ‘really busy  product manager’ in practice. ‘Head of Product’ can sometimes  mean ‘glorified people manager’ in practice. 
- I don’t have a product leader responsible for my support and  development
- There’s a lot of guidance and training on product  management. There's relatively little on product leadership.

## Action 

Leaders lead, and that means going first. The gap in guidance is an opportunity to develop it for myself. Blogging as helped me to collect the lessons I've learned so I can use them in the future.  Here are some of the ways that blogging has helped me.  

### Statement of intent (to myself and for myself)

 I published posts conveying simple tips until late 2017, like '[the five stages of applying the service standard to technical stuff](https://scottcolfer.com/2017/04/26/user-centred-technical-products.html)'. I used a [post](https://scottcolfer.com/2018/01/12/leadership.html) in January 2018 to tell myself that I needed to start figuring out wtf product leadership means. This [post](https://scottcolfer.com/2018/01/12/leadership.html) summarises thinking begun in late 2016 when working with an agile coach on developing my product  leadership skills. 

### Reflecting on things I've experienced

I’ve  hoovered-up ‘stuff’, by accident or design, and used blog posts to  help me make sense of them.  

'Stuff' includes:

- Coaching to improve my performance
- Books on general topics that contain nuggets of wisdom relevant to product leaders
- Meetups (Mind the Product’s leadership meetup; cross-goverment  Heads of Product meetups; suppers and coffees with product peers from  outside the Civil Service; cross-government product manager meetups,  etc)
- Coaching to help others improve their performance. I spend at  least 2 out of every 5 work days supporting members of my profession.  Every time I help someone else to figure out their  problem I hear a fresh way to approach my own problems.

This ‘stuff’ gets mixed in the maelstrom of the working week and  starts to make sense in the quieter moments. During these quieter  moments I’ll make notes. These notes are re-written,  re-worked over time. At a certain point it’s clear that there’s a theme worth  thinking about in more detail. That’s often when I’ll start writing a  blog post as a tool to reflect on some thing I’ve learned. 

### Looking for ways to conceptualise my observations

 I found [The Art of Business Value](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Business-Value-Mark-Schwartz/dp/1942788045) to be helpful. In particular, it helped me to think what value looks like when we don’t measure it through  profit. I read the book over a couple of weeks on the way to and from  work, taking photos of bits that I found particularly useful. I then  turned these photos into notes in a Google Doc over another couple of  months. My notes were rewritten over 2-3 months as I used bits of them at work, finding  out what was useful in practice. This [post](https://scottcolfer.com/2018/03/02/value-context.html)  finally emerged in March 2018, at least 6 months after I first read the  book. It took months to distill a complex set of ideas into something I could start to use in a  practical setting. A year later I simplified it further based on what I learned,  publishing post called ‘[how we can measure value without profit](https://scottcolfer.com/2019/03/19/value-without-profit.html)’.
 
There are limits to blogging but the discipline remains useful. [Lean Enterprise](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425) contains valuable insights.  I read Lean Enterprise in 2015.  There was a free evaluation copy doing the rounds within ‘agile’ circles. The content didn’t sink in at the time.  [I decided to re-read it in March 2018](https://twitter.com/scottcolfer/status/973112388827348993)  and this time it struck a chord. This time I could see it as a  blueprint for how to work with agility at the scale of a large  enterprise. I read it over a couple of weeks, and again I took  photos of the most interesting bits. There were so  many photos that it took me months to type them up. I had a 20-page booklet that I started to calling ‘lean  government’. I could not find a way to shape this booklet into a  single blog post, or even a short-series of blog posts. I still refer to my personal  ‘lean  government’ booklet but have failed to turn it into a blog post. In reality  it has infused 10-20 practical projects at work.  The discipline of wanting to blog helped me re-working my notes until they were useful.  

## Result

I can now explain what product leadership is, in simpler terms. This simple explanation will be the focus of a future post. Simplicity is hard-won. This blog has provided space for reflection. Reflection has helped me turn experiences it into lessons I can learn from. I have been the main audience for my blog posts over the last couple of years.

## Learning

This has all reminded me of my time working on the 'digital transformation' of educations in the 2000s, where I focussed on improving teacher training. One of the things that my team did was fund the use of digital tools to help trainee-teachers collect evidence of their development and reflect on their experiences. I took a module in the Open University's postgraduate course in [online and distance learning](http://www.open.ac.uk/postgraduate/qualifications/d36). One aspect of this that I found useful was breaking learning into several stages, all of which need to happen if we're to genuinely 'learn':

- concrete experience
- reflective observation
- abstract conceptualisation
- active experimentation.

_This is known as David Kolb's [experiential learning cycle](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/doctoralcollege/training/eresources/teaching/theories/kolb)._

In effect, I have concrete experiences in my job and in my quieter moments I note reflective observations. This grow over time and eventually converge with reading or conversations I've had that allow me to conceptualise what's happened. My blog posts help me to pull this together with sufficient definition that I can then actively experiment, eventually coming back to refine several of my initial concepts based on how they're worked in the real world. My blog posts from the last couple of years have largely been tools for personal reflection, helping me to turn real life experiences into real lessons that I can use in the future.

If you can relate to any of the context that I shared at the beginning of this post then I can recommend blogging as a way of helping you to develop as a product leader.
