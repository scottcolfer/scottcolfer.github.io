title: "How blogging helped me become a better product leader"
date: 2019-06-19

I’ve been working out how to develop as a product leader for the last few years. Blogging has been a critical tool in my development. This post summarises and shares the reasons I’ve found blogging to be helpful. 

## Context

The short version is: how do I develop as a product leader when product leadership is a relatively new concept and there's relatively little out there to help?

Longer version:

- I've shifted from product management to product leadership in the last few yeas and have needed to figure out what this means in practice
- Product leadership is relatively new. Roles like 'Senior Product Manager' and 'Lead Product Manager' can sometimes mean 'really busy product manager' in practice. Roles like 'Head of Product' can sometimes mean 'glorified people manager' in practice. There's some way to go until product leadership roles are understood and used to its full potential
- I don't have a product leader responsible for my support and developmet (I've only had more senior product managers above me for 6 months in the last 4 years)
- There's a **lot** of guidance and training on product management but relatively little on product leadership (which often takes the form of 'stakeholder management' workshops).

## Action 

Leaders lead, and that means going first. 
This gap in product leadership training was an opportunity to start figuring some of this out for myself :)
Blogging has been one of the most valuable tools at my disposal when trying to pull together things that I've learned and think will be useful in the fuiture. Here are some of the ways it's helpd me.

### Statement of intent (to myself and for myself)

I was still publishing posts aimed at conveying simple product management tips until late 2017 (like [the five stages of applying the service standard to technical stuff](https://scottcolfer.com/2017/04/26/user-centred-technical-products.html)) but then used a [post](https://scottcolfer.com/2018/01/12/leadership.html) in January 2018 to tell myself that I needed to start thinking about wtf product leadership means. This innocuous [post](https://scottcolfer.com/2018/01/12/leadership.html) actually summarises a year of thinking and work, started at the end of 2016 when I began working with an agile coach on developing my product leadership skills. It took a year of work and development just to get to the point where I could understand the difference between product management and product leadership well enough to begin my professional development in earnest. 

### Reflecting on things I've experienced

In the absence of clear books or training on product leadership I've hoovered-up 'stuff' (by accident or design) and then used blog posts to help me make sense of them. 

'Stuff' includes:

- coaching to improve my performance
- books on general topics that contain nuggets of wisdom relevant to product leaders
- meetups (Mind the Product's leadership meetup; cross-goverment Heads of Product meetups; suppers and coffees with product peers from outside the Civil Service; cross-government product manager meetups, etc)
- coaching to help others improve their performance (I spend at least 2 out of every 5 work days supporting members of my profession; every time you help someone else to figure out a problem for themselves you hear a fresh way to approach your own problems).

All of this 'stuff' gets mixed in the maelstrom of the working week and starts to make sense in the quieter moments. During these quieter moments I'll make notes. Eventually these notes are re-written, re-worked, and at a certain point it's clear that there's a theme worth thinking about in more detail. That's often when I'll start writing a blog post as a tool to reflect on some things I think I've learned.

### Looking for ways to conceptualise my observations

I found [The Art of Business Value](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Business-Value-Mark-Schwartz/dp/1942788045) to be really helpful in lots of ways but in particular because it helps us to think of what value looks like when we don't measure it through profit. I read the book over a couple of weeks on the way to and from work, taking photos of bits that I found particularly useful. I then turned these photos into notes in a Google Doc over another couple of months. These notes in a Google Doc eventually got rewritten and reworked over another 2-3 months as I used bits of them at work, finding out what was useful in practice. This [post](https://scottcolfer.com/2018/03/02/value-context.html) finally emerged in March 2018, at least 6 months after I first read the book (probably longer). It took that long to take a dense set of information and mould it into something I could start to use in a practical sense, and the blog [post](https://scottcolfer.com/2018/03/02/value-context.html) was a great way for me to reflect on what I'd learned from the book that could be practically applied by me in my professional context. I then used this reflection for another year before realising that I could improve it based on what I'd learned by using it for a year, pulling together a simpler post called '[how we can measure value without profit](https://scottcolfer.com/2019/03/19/value-without-profit.html)'.

There are some limits to blogging but the overall discipline is still useful. [Lean Enterprise](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425) is even more densely populated with wisdom for product leaders than The Art of Business Value. I originally read Lean Enterprise back in 2015 because there was a free evaluation copy doing the rounds amongst 'agile' circles, but it didn't all sink in at the time. [I decided to re-read it in March 2018](https://twitter.com/scottcolfer/status/973112388827348993) and this time it really struck a chord. This time, I could see it as a blueprint for how to work with agility at the scale of a large enterprise. Again I read it over a couple of weeks, and again I took photos of the most interesting bits. This time, however, there were so many photos that it took me months and months to type them up. And when I'd typed them up, I have a 20-page booklet that I started to call 'lean government'. And I absolutely could not find a way to shape this into a single blog post, or even a short-series of blog posts. I still have a 'lean government' personal guide that I refer to at times but in reality it has been used to infuse and create 10-20 practical projects at work, rather than becoming an single blog post. The discipline of *wanting* to blog about it helped me to keep re-working my notes until I could use them in a practicaly setting.

## Result

I can now articulate what product leadership is, in simpler terms (including how it's different from product management). 
*Let me know if that's of interest and I'll make this summary the focus of my next post :)*

Simplicity is hard-won. Having a space for reflection has helped me to work and re-work the 'stuff' I've experienced over the last few years, moulding it into lessons that I can learn from. I've been the audience for my blog posts over the last couple of years, and have used them as a space to try and figure out things that hurt my brain.

## Learning

This has all reminded me of my time working on the 'digital transformation' of educations in the 2000s, where I focussed on improving teacher training. One of the things that my team did was fund the use of digital tools to help trainee-teachers collect evidence of their development and reflect on their experiences. I took a module in the Open University's postgraduate course in [online and distance learning](http://www.open.ac.uk/postgraduate/qualifications/d36). One aspect of this that I found useful was breaking learning into several stages, all of which need to happen if we're to genuinely 'learn':

- concrete experience
- reflective observation
- abstract conceptualisation
- active experimentation.

_This is known as David Kolb's [experiential learning cycle](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/doctoralcollege/training/eresources/teaching/theories/kolb)._

In effect, I have concrete experiences in my job and in my quieter moments I note reflective observations. This grow over time and eventually converge with reading or conversations I've had that allow me to conceptualise what's happened. My blog posts help me to pull this together with sufficient definition that I can then actively experiment, eventually coming back to refine several of my initial concepts based on how they're worked in the real world. My blog posts from the last couple of years have largely been tools for personal reflection, helping me to turn real life experiences into real lessons that I can use in the future.

If you can relate to any of the context that I shared at the beginning of this post then I can recommend blogging as a way of helping you to develop as a product leader.
