## Introduction

[Digital Government is 10-years old](https://twitter.com/GDSTeam/status/1468525198014128129?s=20&t=AAYDQrJGLQelJl__FzPAkQ). What will the next 10-years look like?

Last year one of the first-gen GDS folk led a project for my organisation, I got a chance to work with them as part of this. In our final meetup I asked for any big trends they’d spotted and he said something like ‘figuring out what the next 10 years look like for Digital Government . . . some of the big companies can do the Digital thing as well as the in-house teams, they’re competitors . . . what does that mean for the in-house Digital teams?’. Just a few days ago [GDS took-on Deloitte to develop help develop an identity app](https://twitter.com/helenolsen/status/1493878273314639873). There are good and sensible reasons for this, as [shared by Will Myddleton](https://twitter.com/myddelton/status/1493986646760566790). There are good reasons for choosing suppliers to do ‘Digital’ work. I’m not a fundamentalist who believes everything should be done in house. I’m a pragmatist. GDS hiring Deloitte to help build an app was unthinkable a few years ago. Anecdotally, I’m seeing a growing appetite to work with suppliers on ‘Digital delivery’. In-house teams need to accept this and figure out what it means for them. What’s their unique selling point versus external competitors? And what does the next 10-years look like? 

I was going to use this question - ‘what’s the next 10-years of Digital Government?’ - to help me and fellow Heads of Profession build our long-term vision. I’ve now left my organisation so we won’t get a chance to do this together. But it remains an interesting challenge in product-positioning. So after the first 10-years where ‘delivery was the strategy’, here’s why I hope that the next 10-years is about designing our organisations as well as our products.
