# Organisations designed as well as products

## Introduction

[Digital Government is 10-years old](https://twitter.com/GDSTeam/status/1468525198014128129?s=20&t=AAYDQrJGLQelJl__FzPAkQ). What will the next 10-years look like?

Last year one of the first-gen GDS folk led a project at my old organisation, I got a chance to work with them as part of this. In our final meetup I asked for any big trends they’d spotted and he said something like ‘figuring out what the next 10 years look like for Digital Government . . . some of the big companies can do the Digital thing as well as the in-house teams, they’re competitors . . . what does that mean for the in-house Digital teams?’. Just a few days ago [GDS took-on Deloitte to develop help develop an identity app](https://twitter.com/helenolsen/status/1493878273314639873). There are good and sensible reasons for this, as [shared by Will Myddleton](https://twitter.com/myddelton/status/1493986646760566790). There are good reasons for choosing suppliers to do ‘Digital’ work. I’m not a fundamentalist who believes everything should be done in house. I’m a pragmatist. GDS hiring Deloitte to help build an app was unthinkable a few years ago. Anecdotally, I’m seeing a growing appetite to work with suppliers on ‘Digital delivery’. In-house teams need to accept this and figure out what it means for them. What’s their unique selling point versus external competitors? And what does the next 10-years look like? 

I was going to use this question - ‘what’s the next 10-years of Digital Government?’ - to help me and fellow Heads of Profession build our long-term vision. I’ve now left my organisation so we won’t get a chance to do this together. But it remains an interesting challenge in product-positioning. So after the first 10-years where ‘delivery was the strategy’, here’s why I hope that the next 10-years is about designing our organisations as well as our products.

## Pioneering to settling

You’ve probably heard someone talk about pioneers, setters and town planners. I can be a contrarian, so I avoided using it for ages. But, revisiting it a couple of years ago, I was struck by how well it described patterns I’d been seeing. I got over my contrary nature and started using it. 

‘Pioneers settlers town planners’ is the work of Simon Wardley. A summary of the model can be found on [Wardleypedia.org](https://wardleypedia.org/mediawiki/index.php/Pioneers_settlers_town_planners). As Simon himself would say, it’s a model and it’s wrong but it still has value. So here’s a version I’ve simplified and tweaked for the purposes of this post.

| Pioneers      | Settlers | Town planners |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Creates new technology | Grows use of products | Increases efficiency |
| Uses agile and components   | Uses ecosystems | Uses six sigma |
| Accepts uncertainty      | Accepts constant improvement | Accepts analytical decision-making |
| Deals with the new and poorly understood | Deals with increasing education | Deals with standardisation |

## Ground work

Preparation for Digital Government began during Tony Blair’s third Ministry (2005-2007), led by the Cabinet Office. Gus O’Donnell, the Cabinet Secretary at the time, regularly spoke about about two things: managing risk (instead of trying to avoid it) and customer insights. The Cabinet Office published a working paper called ‘Customer insight in public services - “A Primer”’ in 2006.It included guidance on using tools like customer journey mapping to improve services. The front page is a quote from Gus O’Donnell:

“We must be relentlessly customer-focused. Many people want a single point of contact for a range of services. The public are not interested in whether their needs are met by Department X or Agency Y, they just want a good, joined-up service where X and Y talk to each other and share information the public have provided. We should strive to meet this demand.”

## First-wave Digital Government: Pioneering

### First 10-years belonged to pioneers

It’s not a stretch to see the first 10-years or so of Digital Government as the age of pioneers. Simply existing in the first place was pioneering. Delivery of the initial [25 exemplars](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gds-transformation-programme-2013-to-2015/digital-transformation-exemplar-services) was pioneering work. The introduction of components following the ‘Government as a Platform’ movement was pioneering work. Every Government organisation with a Digital portfolio has done pioneering work over the last few years that adds-up to exciting change in how public services are delivered in the UK.

## Components and trust

Components are interesting to me. This is where I joined the Digital Government work. I joined in 2015 to help the Ministry of Justice create what’s now called the ‘Platforms and Architecture’ business unit. I also got to work with, share with and learn from other Government Departments like Home Office and HMRC who were starting similar work around the same time. And GDS, where there was a lot of collaboration with the GaaP folks. I even got to lead the assessment of some of the early GaaP Alphas. I came to realise a couple of important things back in 2015:

1. It’s easy to think of components as ‘technical products’ and skip user-centred design. I don’t agree with this.The root of the word ‘technical’ is ‘technique’. What people mean when they say ‘technical product’ is ‘a product with techniques I don’t understand’. They’re staff-facing products. As staff-facing products they need to be well designed in order to be adopted.
2. The value proposition for components is trust. We all have a tendency towards exceptionalism. We believe we’re doing something so unique it requires a totally bespoke approach. The truth is we’re often more similar than we are different. Components take a custom activity that used to be in someone’s control. Removes that control. And tells people they’re not as special as they thought. That requires a lot of trust.

### Pioneering and settling happen at the same time

More recently I’ve realised that ‘pioneering’, ‘settling’ and ‘town-planning’ are not discrete, sequential stages. Rather, they all need to start at the same time because they each take longer than the last. Each phase happens at a different speed. Because each phase is harder than the last and requires more energy. I came to realise that ‘settling’ is the past where trust is built across the organisation. This trust is a critical dependency for adoption of components. And maybe, the pioneering work has become a means to an end. The real goal, right now, is to focus on settling: designing the ecosystem in which we operate as well as we designed our pioneering products.

## Second-wave Digital Government: Settling

I saw a Tweet a few months ago. It said something like: ‘the must-have skills in the 2010s was software development, in the 2020s it’s going to be community management’. I think there’s truth in this. Viewed from the perspective of the Civil Service, ‘Digital’ has become part of the furniture. No longer are people excited by the simple act of creation of in-house software. Now it needs to actually be used, at scale. Fundamentally, there’s a switch to return on investment (or benefits realisation in the language of Government). There’s an increasing need to (i) seek the best opportunities for benefits realisation and (ii) focus on the mature phase of the product lifecycle (or ‘Live’ in the language of Government). Both of these things need us to be as interested in our organisations as we are in the problems we’re solving for our users. And both of these things require us to recognise that the software is (usually) not our product. 

If we want to grow the use of our products and develop new opportunities we need to invest in understanding the ecosystem we’re a part of. We need to switch to constant improvement of mature products. And we need to deal with the increasing need to communicate and educate. We’ve always had to do these things but, in my experience, it’s always been invisible work. Activity to understand our organisation or to develop our culture has largely been invisible from portfolios that tend to favour our ‘official’ class of work: reporting delivery of IT assignments alongside budget lines. In many instances we’ve been rewiring the house around us in order to achieve relatively simply ‘digital delivery’ but this organisational change doesn’t appear on any sprint backlogs or roadmaps.
