**Working title**

Good Product Management Volume 1

**Drafting**

In my [last update](https://scottcolfer.com/2020/08/23/2020-book-update-beginning-end.html) I spoke about creating a newsletter. My intention was to use it to chunk-up the drafting process. This worked well. I've published 15,000+ words of draft ideas and content. It's gone beyond writing down what I know already and helped me to learn new things. The act of writing down my stories for an audience forced me to think in a sustained way. Often the newsletter episode was the beginning of thinking that I then took further and came to new conclusions.

One example was capability. I realised I'd never given serious thought to what I meant by skills and behaviours. How are they different to each other? This sparked some research and tweaking and led to a model for thinking about how our overall capability is linked to our specialist skills and general behaviours, helped by knowledge from others and improved through practice, practice, practice. This will help me tie together a bunch of stuff that's felt loose and unclear until now, so it should be more valuable for others. This is just one example amongst many. The published episodes are often the tip of the iceberg of the thinking they helped me with.

The newsletter also helped me to think about the scope, structure, and format of the book.

Scope
Limited to product management. Leaving out product leadership.

Structure
Copy from Trello

Format
Copy from Trello

Publishing
Self-publish, 100-200

Next
Break then pull book together
Test remaining assumptions, start by speaking with people whoâ€™ve written books and work out from there.
Product leadership next.
