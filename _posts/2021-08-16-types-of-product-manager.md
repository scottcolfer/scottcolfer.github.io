title: "What type of product manager are you?"

Folks ask me how to get into product management. I could talk to fill time and make myself feel important. But instead I stop and ask them what kind of product management they want to get into?

We talk about ‘product management’ like it’s a single thing. But it isn’t. There’s no meaningful or useful certification. There’s no real professional body. There’s folks doing stuff. Product management means different things to different people. The day-to-day reality of the role can vary from organisation to organisation. From product to product. And, sometimes, from hour to hour. 

I’ve created a diagram to show the main types of product manager. It's based on personal experience and the experiences of others. There’s no ultimate ‘right’ version of product management. There’s right for right now. If we’re choosing the right version for the right reasons then everything’s good. What’s important is to recognise the types and use them with intent. I’ve been all these types of product manager over the years.

Let’s look at our diagram and ask the quesstion: What type of product manager are you?

The diagram’s got two axes. 
Axis 1: Product Owner → Product Manager

Product Owner is someone who leads their team’s tactics for building something.This version of the role might focus on outputs (e.g. software features). At its simplest, we’re playing the Product Owner role as described in the Scrum Guide.

Product Manager is someone who leads their product’s strategy for improving value. This version of the role focuses on outcomes (e.g. benefits for their users and their organisation). At its simplest, we’re playing the Product Manager role described in the UK Government’s Digital, Data, and Technology Capability Framework.
