Want to improve your [discovery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works)? 
Here are 10 things you and your organisation can try to make your discovery even more valuable, based on a recent [retrospective of discovery](http://scottcolfer.com/2017/08/14/discovery-retro-questions.html).

## Experiment 1: Can’t interview? Don’t start.

Data/research suggests that

- teams can wait for weeks to carry out their first interviews with users when they have to develop a route to users. This means that the first few weeks of discovery may have limited return on investment and the final weeks are over-loaded with interviews and do not have enough time for the team to draw conclusions before discovery ends

So if we try

- starting discovery when the first interview can take place within 3 days 

And measure

- time taken for first interview
- time taken to complete discovery
- % of discoveries requiring extensions
- confidence in discovery insights

We should see this change

- better insights from discovery (with ‘better’ defined as team and stakeholder confidence in these insights)

## Experiment 2: Subject matter experts are invaluable

Data/research suggests that

- subject matter experts being a core member of a discovery team increases the value of the discovery (and may reduce the time taken to complete discovery)

So if we try

- increasing the involvement of subject matter experts with the core discovery team (where this is useful)

And measure

- % of discovery team ceremonies attended by stakeholders
- time take to carry out first user interview
- amount of time spent with users during discovery
- % of discoveries that require a deadline extension

We should see this change

- greater confidence in outcomes of discovery (and potentially shorter discoveries).

## Experiment 3: Don’t be too digital

Data/research suggests that

- discoveries carried out by ‘Digital’ teams will tend to skew discoveries towards digital solutions (i.e. in-house software)

So if we try

- Digital 'plus’ teams (better mix of ‘the business’/policy/analytical services, etc and ‘digital’)

And measure

- % of discoveries that lead to digital solutions

We should see this change

- greater balance of digital/non-digital solutions

## Experiment 4: Lean Startup over Scrum

Data/research suggests that

- ‘pure’ [Scrum](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) is not a great framework for discovery and [alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) because it expects requirements and value to be defined up-front

So if we try

- a hypothesis-driven approach as described in [The Lean Startup](http://scottcolfer.com/2012/06/05/lean-startup-for-product-managers.html)

And measure

- % of discoveries that do not continue to alpha
- % of discoveries that pivot the problem, or user, or both
- % of discoveries that recommend pausing until conditions are right for alpha
- % of discoveries that suggest that ‘digital’ isn’t the best, or only solution space to explore in alpha

We should see this change

- data-driven decisions in discovery; teams able to share the hypotheses how they’ve tested to draw conclusions as to the value of a problem being solved.

## Experiment 5: Share discovery guidance

Data/research suggest that

- dysfunction can appear during discovery due to a lack of shared understanding of the value of discovery, and the approach to discovery
- members of discovery teams may not have the same understanding 
- discovery teams and their [Service Manager](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/service-owner-role-description/service-owner-role-description) may not have the same understanding as ‘the business’/stakeholders

So if we try

- sharing discovery guidance

And measure

- % of discovery team members, Service Managers and stakeholders that can consistently describe the value and approach to discovery
- stakeholders/’the business’ satisfaction with discovery  

We should see this change

- teams encounter less dysfunction due to uncertainty around the point of discovery and the approach to discovery, and stakeholders’ expectations around discovery being met more consistently.

## Experiment 6: Don’t reinvent the wheel

Data/research suggests that

- some of the core concepts of discovery and alpha (new to government) share more with project management concepts (familiar to government) than we expect

So if we try

- highlighting similarities between agile development and project management
- learning from project management
- sharing guidance on when project management is the best approach, and when working with agility is the best approach

And measure

- % of ‘work’ that makes an informed choice in the best model (agile or project) based on the conditions in which it’s working 

We should see this change

- the right approach is taken for the right ‘work’ because there is greater shared understanding of how the approaches work and the value of their differences.

## Experiment 7: Show me the money

Data/research suggests that

- discovery teams would like greater accountability 

So if we try

- making discovery teams aware of their budget and the rate at which they are spending it

And measure

- the average cost of a discovery

We should see this change

- average cost decreases

## Experiment 8: What’s a pre-discovery?

Data/research suggests that

- pre-discovery has become a common stage of development but has yet to be clearly defined so is used inconsistently

So if we try

- defining the value of a pre-discovery stage, and deciding if it should exist, and (if ‘yes’) applying it correctly

And measure

- number of pre-Discoveries that take place in the future versus in the past
- % discovery teams reporting that a pre-discovery helped their discovery

We should see this change
- pre-discovery of more use to discovery teams 
Or
- pre-discovery of more use to portfolio
Or
- pre-discovery no longer used
Or
- ???

## Experiment 9: Clearer briefs

Data/research suggest that

- discovery teams can spend several days (sometimes over a week) clarifying the brief for a discovery 

So if we try

- a consistent approach to discovery briefs

And measure

- average time spent by a team defining the brief

We should see this change

- teams begin discovery sooner

## Experiment 10: Run regular Discovery retrospectives

Data/research suggests that

- the [questions](http://scottcolfer.com/2017/08/14/discovery-retro-questions.html) used to carry out the retrospective that led to these hypotheses worked well

So if we try

- team/organisational discovery retrospectives using similar [questions](http://scottcolfer.com/2017/08/14/discovery-retro-questions.html)

And measure

- responses

We should see this change

- improvement in discovery.

### *Notes*

- *note 1: I wrote a post about [product roadmaps](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/08/03/make-the-most-of-your-roadmap/) in which I highlighted a format for hypotheses shared by Jock Busuttil and have used that format for this post*
- *note 2: it'd be great to hear from anyone who tries any of these hypotheses or has suggestions of their own, say hello on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottcolfer) or share suggestions on Github.
