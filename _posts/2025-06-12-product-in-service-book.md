title: "My book: 'Product in Service: A Manifesto for Pragmatic Product Management"

My book's nearly finished.

**Product in Service** adapts product management for the service sector with a focus on non-profit services provided by National Government, Local Government, Healthcare, Education, and Charity.

Product operating models are popular in these spaces but product management rarely works ‘as is’ since it’s not designed for essential services run by large, old, complicated organisations often supporting entire nations, including the most vulnerable members of society.

- How does product management work in the service sector?
- What is ‘the product’ when you work on a service?
- How do you overcome product purism and find a more pragmatic product management that actually works?

This book answers these questions (plus many more) and provides a manifesto for pragmatic product management based on practice (not theory or frameworks).
