title: "The product manager is dead. Long live the value manager."

The label of 'product manager' doesn't usefully describe what I do. 

I was introduced a new colleague recently, and they said 'Ah, you're a product guy!' and then proceeded to ask me about software that helped print large collections of documents. Their assumption was that, as a product manager, I am something close to a walking catalogue of products - which is fair enough, with a title like product manager, right?

The reality is that it's been years since product managers were people 'from the business' (possibly a tame technical specialist or subject matter expert) who would be placed in to a development team what features their software should have. Product management in 2017 is more likely to be about creating a strategy that maximises the value of a service, working with a team to set goals that descrbe what the increase in value looks like if they're successful but leaving the team to figure out how to do it. 

But we don't have a way to describe this yet. 

I'd like to suggest that the product manager is dead. Long live the value manager.

## Identity crisis in product management

Look at the product management posts and talks of 2017 and a pattern emerges. We're having a crisis of identity.
This is clearest in the 'product owner or product manager?' posts and talks. [Melissa Perri](https://medium.com/@melissaperri/product-manager-vs-product-owner-57ff829aa74d) summarises this discussion succinctly: 

> Product Owner is a role you play on a Scrum team. Product Manager is the job {...} A good Product Manager is taught how to prioritize work against clear outcome oriented goals, how to discover and validate real customer and business value, and what processes are needed to reduce the uncertainty that the product will succeed in market. Without this background in Product Management, someone can effectively go through the motions of Product Owner role in Scrum, but they can never be successful in making sure they are building the right thing.

[Roman Pichler](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-manager-vs-product-owner/) has recently written a similar post:

> The confusion stems—at least partly—from the fact that Scrum is a simple framework focused on helping teams develop software. It does not cover common product management practices, such as, product strategy development, product roadmapping, and financial forecasting; and the only product management tool it offers is the product backlog.

Government product management (my bit of the product world) has been exploring this too, with [Ross Ferguson](https://medium.com/@rossferg/product-manager-or-product-owner-7b0033b693c1) saying that government needs the skills of product managers rather than product owners, and [Zoe Gould](https://medium.com/@Zoe_On_The_Go/and-that-is-what-a-product-owner-owns-c60f62df713e) essentially agreeing but saying that we shouldn't get too hung-up on labels. 

The main theme I took from this year's Mind the Product conference was lots of people sharing my experience that I hadn't chosen features for products in years, and that the role of the product manager has become one of strategy and value, helping teams to set goals that describe and increase in value then getting out of the way and empowering the team to figure out how to do that. Martin Eriksson's post frmo earlier in the year acts as a summary of the message we heard time and again throughout the conference: [we are not the CEO's of our products](https://medium.com/@bfgmartin/product-managers-you-are-not-the-ceo-3441cb3914e4), our role is to lead by setting clear goals that hold teams accountable but also empower them to own the solutions. Martin's closing remarks for this year's conference were that the label of 'product manager' hasn't really fit the role we do for a while now. I've been thinking the same for a while too.

How did we get here? And is there a better way of describing what we do?

## It started with soap

A product is something that you buy and own, like soap. I have never managed a 'product', despite having been a product manager for over a decade. A service is [something you use but do not own](http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/video-what-service-design), like Netflix. This better describes the things I've worked on. So why are we product managers, not service managers?

### ‘You’ll be a little lovelier each day with fabulous pink Camay’

It’s 1931. Neil McElroy is in charge of promoting the Camay soap brand for Proctor & Gamble. Neil is frustrated that Camay always plays second fiddle to P&G’s leading brand, Ivory. 

> In a famous memo to management, he argued for the creation of the role of “brand manager”. This person would take overall responsibility for the commercial success of a product, managing it holistically like a business in its own right. *- The Practitioner’s Guide to Product Management by Jock Busuttil, p.10*

P&G agreed, and Neil paved the way for the profession of product management - our profession grew out of managing genuine products, in such a way as to maximise their value.

### Agile and software and scrum, oh my

It’s 2001. The manifesto for agile software development was created by a group including Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle in February, and then Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle publish Agile Software Development with Scrum’in October (quick work, huh?). In 2002, Schwaber and others found the Scrum Alliance. The agile manifesto and accompanying principles say that we should seek to maximise the value of software, by prioritising features based on how valuable and delivering them asap. The scrum framework interprets the agile manifesto as a framework for development teams to use, and names product managers as the members of the team who prioritise the features to be developed, based on how valuable they are. The scrum framework also chooses to rebrand product managers as ‘product owners’. Neil McElroy’s vision of someone managing a product and running it like a business in its own right has been taken and rebooted for software, by the scrum framework . . . promoting the role of product manager in the process under the banner of ‘product owner’.

In 2001, software is still predominantly sold in shops, in boxes, on discs. It is something that you buy, and own. It is a product, so a product manager/owner makes sense. 

### There is no cloud, it's just someone elses computer

It's 2011. 'Software as a service' is now a thing. SaaS describes a shift in the relationship between businesses and consumers where by consumers rent use of software, with consumer hardware acting as terminals that access software that remains stored on the businesses computer, via the internet. In the realm of '[cloud computing](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/22/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-cloud-and-platforms-but-were-afraid-to-ask/)', we no longer own the software we use. Software ceases to be a product and becomes a service. This leads to a huge shift in production, with successful companies breaking traditional barriers between design, development, operations, sales and marketing in order to have the much quicker sales cycles needed to compete in this market. Annual sales cycles for software products don't cut it for software as a service: massive projects and formal handovers between departments are a good way to go out of business. Co-located, cross-disciplinary teams are increasingly standard.

Which means that product managers need to adapt. The traditional scrum product owner, focussed on software features, does't work when each product mission needs to include work on your service wrapper, sales, and marketing - all of whom are likely to be part of the product team. Communities like ‘Mind the Product’ emerge, publishing their now famous article [what exactly is a product manager?](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/10/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/), which attempts to figure out what product management means when we no longer manage products. The now ubiquitous overlapping circles place product management at the heart of user experience, technology, and business - showing what the scrum product owner role, focussing on new features, does not encompass the skills needed of a product manager.

### A product is (usually) not a business

. . . which brings us back to today, and our current identity crisis in product management. As anyone who has taken or taught on the General Assembly product manager course will know, **'a product is (usually) not the business'**. A product or service is only valuable when it is in the hands of a user, and getting software in the hands of a user takes more that just new features. A 'product manager' is accountable for the strategy by which the value of a product or service (and, increasingly, it's a service) is maximised. We're generalist amongst a team of specialists, hired to be the person in a team who's passionate about the problem and the value of solving that problem, rather than the solution itself. We succeed when we help the team to prioritise its activity to best increase the value of the service, through data-driven prioritisation of goals. We manage value, not the product or service itself. The product or service is built and operated by the teams we work with. 

We manage value. We own the strategy by which we maximise the value of services. 


2005: https://www.kennorton.com/essays/productmanager.html 

In https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B008FYYCT8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1 Mark Butje says that product managers are like CEOs . . . ‘powerless CEOs’. 
“The product manager is a weird person - someone who takes on an enormous amount responsibility without actually being in charge. Sort of like a CEO but without the hierarchic power.” quote

Will scrum be the death of the product manager
https://aimconsulting.com/insights/blog/will-scrum-be-the-death-of-product-management/ 

We look for value in the dark

We agreed that we don’t have Technical Product Managers - change to SME thing.
The time is now.
Product Management has made its way to government.
Limits of scrum.

Vision
Better described as ‘value manager’.
Value strategy. Uncover the value context. then create value stratgey.

Value manager also helps our colleagues that we can work in the intangible space known as 'senior leadership’. 'Product’ is a tangible thing and makes our colleague think that 'you don’t need a product manager when there’s no product’. However, 'portfolio’ is just another type of backlog, & all the tricks we’ve learned in development teams work in portfolio teams.

Add description of product manager from value book:

"A core principle of Agile and Lean theory is that software development should seek to maximise business value. Projects should be judged not on their adherence to cost and schedue milestones, but on their delivery of value to the enterprise. Value should be delivered as quickly as possible - in small increments - and features should be prioritised based on the amount of value they deliver."

'We all understand the goal of private value - it's to generate profit and return value to shareholders. The ultimate goal of public services is not to generate profit, and we don't have shareholders. So what's 'public value'? You could argue that the financial objective of public value is to hit targets for liquidity: having just enough resources to carry out the mission, but not too much. The criteria for its success - its definition of business value - is about accomplishing its mission." p27

"A government agency has other value concerns beyond those directly related to its mission area."
'It values fairness in procurement practices, transparency, public accountability, and the political goals of those in power. Government is unique in that one of its resources is its authority to compel behaviour but doing so also has an opportunity cost. The magnitude of the punishment for for non-compliance is a cost to society.'
'The government places a high value on trnasparency.' Trust. 'Whilst companies can keep secrets, government is accountable to the public and must disclose its actions and decisions. There is value assigned to demonstrating trustworthiness. The government is always in the public eye, with the press always reporting on government.' p58 
'Government is in an environment that is quick to assign blame and has become highly risk averse, so places value on things that mitigate risk.'
