I was rencently throwing out some old receipts and was suprised to find that I bought my first espresso machine eight years ago - it made me realise that I've come a long way since those first bitter, watery attempts back when the UK was starting prepartion to host the Olympics. Here's what I've learned in that time.

## Why espresso?

There are loads of reasons why [you shouldn't bother making your own espresso at home](https://scottcolfer.com/coffee/2017/12/24/manual-espresso-at-home.html) but for me it's my go-to type of coffee. Espresso is thicker and has more concentrated falvours than most other types of coffee, and you can drink a couple of them because they contain less caffeine than other types of coffee (caffeine is more concentrated in espresso than other coffees but the overall small volume means there's less caffeine in total. I also enjoy the simple fact that I can make decent espresso at home - it's something that lots of people don't have the kit, the patience, or the practice to do - so I take pleasure in making it and friends enjoy the novelty of drinking it. 

## Coffee beans

Coffee beans have different flavours - depends on where and how they grow, how the coffee beans are removed, and how they are roasted
Say a little about each of the above
Roasting: 2 cracks

Espresso beans normally a blend

Square Mile

'Italian-style' coffee in the UK typically means darkly-roasted

## Coffee grinder

Currently got . . . (give some measurements for Square Mile)
Talk about grind size (larger, quicker; finer - slower)
Includes scales to allow you to measure
Tamper

Started off with a DeLonghi - good for learning, decent for darkly roasted coffee

Increased ability to absorb coffee by filtering (London water contains a lot of disolved solids already, water becomes saturated at a certain point)
