'2020 vision' was the name of lots of vision statements and strategies I worked to in the early 2000s. I guess the people writing the visions liked the pun. But I'd also guess that 2020 being so far away was appealling. Most of what was written in those strategies did not come to pass. I'd wager that most of those strategies are now deleted from existencce, or gathering digital dust on privately-hosted network devices payed for by long-forgotten hosting contracts.
