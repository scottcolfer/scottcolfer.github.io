title: "2020 Vision"
date: 2020-01-06

'2020 vision' was the name of lots of vision statements and strategies I worked to in the early 2000s. Most of what was written in those strategies did not come to pass. I'd wager that most of those strategies are now deleted from existencce, or gathering digital dust on privately-hosted network devices payed for by long-forgotten hosting contracts. 
I guess the people writing the visions liked the pun. But I'd also guess that 2020 being so far away was appealling. As 2020 has approached I've seen fewer and fewer '2020 visions'. Probably because 2020 has been too close for comfort. In reality, I think that this is the perfect time to have a 2020 vision. 2020 is here. A 2020 vision would describe what we're going to do in the next 12 months. It'd be a real commitment to something.
So here's my 2020 vision, split between real life and work life:

- in real life, I'm going to try and be a good dad. My daughter's due to be born in a couple of days. It's exciting. 
- in work life, I'm going to try and pull together what I've learned in the last decade. It's time for a review and retrospective to see what I can learn.

# Being a dad

My daughter's due to be born in the next couple of days. Me and my partner are really excited. This is our first child so we've been in learning and prep mode for the last few months but now everything's about to happen. We've decided to share parental leave straight down the middle, taking 6 months each. 2020's going to be much focussed on being a dad in real life than over anything in work life. You're not going to see me popping up and talking about product management this year as much as you have in previous years, and I'm unlikely to respond to Twitter or LinkedIn messages as much as I have done in previous years. Unless your message is about parenting :)
I've been working since I was 13, starting out in retail on Saturdays and going on from there. This will be the longest I've been away from work since I was 13. I took 3 months away from work in my first term of university, other than that I've had no more than 2-3 weeks away from work for most of my career. It's going to be weird. But now feels like a good time. My career's in a good place, I've got nothing to prove to anyone (including myself). I can focus on real life for a change. I actually worked in parent advocacy services at the beginning of the decade and it's been great being able to return to that, using the insights from other parents to help get ready to be a dad. Me and my partner are both looking forward to meeting our new human and seeing what they become over the years.

# The book

I'm still going to think about my career in 2020. In between nappies and coffee I'm going to crave some 'grown-up' thinking. I've been thinking about corporate visions and strategies, and how most of the ones I've seen in my career haven't seemed to connect with the reality of what teams are doing. For all of the innovation, vision, and strategies in the world, I've found two things to be true:

- we ship our organisation chart
- wee're defined by our work in progress.

My professional experience to date suggests that coroporate visions and strategies that don't focus on organisational design and work in progress will fail to make a dent in the reality of what teams do. My assumption right now is that 'stuff' that helps work in progress will have more impact on teams than stuff that's aspirational and talks about what an organisation would like to be in the future. There's space for both perspectives. Both are needed. But I've often seen aspiration over work in progress. So I'd like to approach a small bit of this problem, and help product managers in large, complex organisations with work in progress. 

I'm on version 3 of the handbook for my product management profession. It's main weakness to date has been to structure support for associate product managers, and to structure support for the move from product manager to product leader. So it's been great to work with Jon Foreman at GDS over the last 18 months to improve both of these areas. Another weakness has been to make it simple enough to engage with, without missing out key aspects of the role. Having now tested and improved the handbook over the last couple of years, this balance has now been struck. 

Now feels like the right time to pull together a book to help product managers in large, complex organisations with their work in progress. My thinking is that I can take my handbook as a starting point and then edit it and simplify it whenever I'm looking for 20-30 minutes of grownup thinking. In addition to this, I want to do a review and retrospective of the last decade of my career. I think some of the real-life, influential moments of my career will help to bring some of my hard won lessons to life, for myself and for others. I spoke at a conference in November and shared three real stories from the last 10 years. All of which included challenge and failure, as much as success. I really enjoyed preparing for the talk, and found that it helped me to draw-out some thinking that'd been swirling around in the back of my mind for a while.

I'm not going to stress about the book. If it happens, it happens. Irrespective, the thinking about the book is appealling to me. Whenever I ahve the headspace and motivation, I'll review what I think I know about product management and test it against the reality of my career. I'll return to some pivotal moments in my life as a product manager in the 2010s and see what I can learn from them. And I'll get out of the house and have coffee with product manager folks and people who've written a book to catchup and see what I can learn from them. If that adds up to a book, then great. If it doesn't, then I'll be returning to work as a better Head of Product once my parental leave comes to an end.
