# Prologue

"Scott, are you OK? You look exhausted."

December 2016. Several people have asked me if I'm OK over the last couple of months. Two or three of them make time to chat with me. I bump into Georg, our executive coach, whilst getting some water in the kitch and he asks "Scott, are you OK? You look exhausted." I give a quick version of what's on my plate from behind tired eyes.

2016 saw me shift from senior product manager, to lead product manager, to unofficial head of product. In December of that year I'm directly managing 15 product managers (along with a couple of Web Operations Engineers), have just completed 5 simultaneous recruitment campaigns, and remain hands-on product manager for a couple of teams. I've just completed work with other heads of product on the first role description and career pathway for product managers in government which has been a great experience but taken a lot of time and effort. This was too much for one person to do. I was burned out.

Georg suggests I make time to have a chat with him to see if we improve things. A few days later we meet in the week before the Christmas break. And so began my real development as a product leader.

# Introduction

This post is based on my experiences of moving from product management to 'product leadership' over the last few years. 

My recent perspective from within a large organisation, within an even larger organisation that has existed for a long time and needs to change how it operates in under to survive in the modern age. My perspective is also from a specialist leadershop role (product management) at a time when leaders are often generalists. 

More specifically:
- I’ve progressed from product management to product leadership over the last 3 years
- There’s some way to go until product leadership roles are understood and used to their full potential. ‘Senior Product Manager’ and ‘Lead Product Manager’ can sometimes mean ‘really busy product manager’ in practice. ‘Head of Product’ can sometimes mean ‘glorified people manager’ in practice.
- I don’t have a product leader responsible for my support and development
- There’s a lot of guidance and training on product management. There’s relatively little on product leadership

If you're context is similar to the above then this post will be of particular relevance to you, however if you're willing to squint then most current or aspiring product leaders will see something of interest.

# Chapter 1: Leadership

Georg and I had leadership coaching sessions together throughout 2017 that helped me to reflect on what I was learning about leadership. First thing-up was to figure out what general leadership means whilst working with agility. Georg's first recommended reading was [Management 3.0](https://jurgenappelo.com/management-30/) by Jurgen Appelo. This book helped consolidate on the type of leader I wanted to be, and the types of leaders I didn't want to be. It comes highly recommended. The short version is that **modern leaders need the ability to do the right thing and do the thing right in the midst of complexity** ('management 3.0') whilst avoiding hierarchical leadership ('management 1.0'), and meme leadership ('managment 2.0').  

### Leadership 1.0: Old hierarchies

Organisations with outdated, hierarchical structures are designed and managed in a top-down fashion, and power is in the hands of the few. The people at the bottom have little money, few responsibilities, and little motivation to do a good job. This is often described as 'command-and-control'. It is often mistakenly likened to a military-style structure, however the military abandoned this approach many decades ago. This type of leadership can function in conditions of high-certainty and low-change but is poorly suited to conditions of low-certainity and high-change: when decisions are made by a small number of people, the organisation maximum speed of response to changing conditions is dicated by the decision-making capability and speed of that small number of people.  

The Government of the United Kingdom is arguably around 800 years old. It is old. But times, they are a-changing. The [information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) has seen massive and rapid change in the UK that has irrevocably changed the relationship between the public and Government in the UK, with much higher expectations of public services. The UK's Civil Service is undergoing significant change to keep-pace with this change. John Manzoni, Chief Executive of the Civil Service, challenged Civil Service leaders to leave old hierarchies behind and embrace a new type of leadership in his [Civil Service Transformation speach](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/civil-service-transformation-speech) in early 2018: 

"We need leaders with empathy, who can manage their teams through transformation and encourage continuous improvement. Leaders with broader experience, who are effective in a complex, multidisciplinary world, who lead with their hearts and their guts, as well as their heads, who see the big picture. Leaders whose instincts - developed through experience - are collaborative; who are used to working across boundaries, confident beyond their own professional area, and inspire and empower their teams."

So I wanted to avoid command-and-control leadership by focussing on emapthetic, collaborate, empowering leadership - in order to help build an organisation that can respond quickly and decisively to the rapid changes taking place in modern UK.

### Leadership 2.0: Meme leadership 

There are add-ons designed the problems of old, hierarchical organisations. To summarise and paraphrase Jurgen Appelo, there are a lot of leadership fads (he gives Six Sigma as one example) that act as add-ons for hierarchical organisations. They ease the problems of these organisations without fundamentally changing the way that leadership takes place. Leadership 2.0 is just Leadership 1.0 with added-fads that release pressure built up within an old system.

I like the word 'fad' but think 'meme' works even better. [Simon Wardley](https://twitter.com/swardley) has used the word 'meme' to describe leadership strategy, and it's stuck with me. I think 'meme' is more forgiving than 'fad'. A fad is a 'trivial fancy adopted for a while with irrational zeal', whereas a meme a unit of cultural information that is transmitted from one mind to another through repeated action. The cultural information that starts a meme may be valuable but this value may be lessened through repeated transmission. I'm about to list some common leadership memes and want to clarify that the inherent concepts are valuable in each case, but repeated transmission sometimes breaks them free of their true meaning. Sometimes they swtich and become the opposite of their original intent. With that being said, here's my top-3 leadership memes :)

**1. #agileatscale**

I'm going to stick my neck out and say that, for me, working with agility can be summarised as two things. Firstly, focus on outcomes over outputs. Secondly, release stuff early and often to check you're getting the outcomes you want. There's more depth to the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) than by brutally reductive summary. In fact, let's assume that my summary leaves a lot to be desired. The point is that working with agility is based on simple principles, by design.

'Agile at scale' has emerged as a concept in the last few years. At its heart, it's a great concept. It implies they following:
'Ok folks - you know that our delivery teams have been focussing on outcomes for users for a few years now - and it's improve the value of our products and services? Well, what if our middle-management and leadership teams did the same thing? And we used a common understanding of value to link-up the way that they layers of our organisation work together?' Or something like that. What this implies is that middle-management and leadership teams look at all of the years or work undertaken by their 'delivery' teams and realise that they now need to do the same thing themselves.

What sometimes happens is that a framework like Large-Scale Scrum ('[LeSS](https://less.works/)') or the Scaled Agile Framework ('[SAFe](https://www.scaledagile.com/)') is lifted and shifted onto an organisation without changing any of that organisation's fundamental structure. This isn't a dig at either of those frameworks. If an organisation has gone through 1-5 years of organisational transformation at all levels, and found that Scrum (for example) is the perfect framework to drive its product tactics and found another tool to drive product strategy and business strategy then something like LeSS could be a great fit. However, if it's dropped onto an organisation without leadership and management structures fundamentally switching to a focus on outcomes over outputs and releasing stuff early and often to check you're getting the outcomes you want, then it's chances of success are slim. It's likely to become an add-on to prop-up an old, hierarchical organisation. I've previously worked for a large enterprise that adopted [scrum of scrums](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum-of-scrums/). The products within the scrum of scrums didn't have sufficient alignment of to allow it to work, and there was no corresponding transformation of management. The experiment was quietly dropped after a couple of months. I've shared this experience with a few folks over the years and periodically I get an email saying like ''My leadership team is about to adopt Less/Safe/etc. It's going to be a car crash. How do I help them to stop before it's too late?'. The struggle is real.

Working with agility means something like focussing on outcomes over outputs and releasing stuff early and often to check you're getting the outcomes you want. If every level of your organisation is expected to do this, and to work with all other levels of your organisation in doing so, then you're working with agility at scale.

**2. #digitaltransformation**

Be honest. Do you really know what you mean when you tell people that you 'work in digital?' And do you think anyone else understands what it means? Be honest. Think of those glazed eyes at in the pub, at parties and family gatherings. The opaque nature of the word 'digital' was recently criticised by UK Government's Science and Technology Select Committee's [Digital Government inquiry](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/digital-government-17-19/). Their [report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/1455/145510.htm) concluded that the open-ended definition of "digital" made it difficult to assess progress made by the digital agenda.

So wtf does 'digital' actually mean? Harriett Green and Myra Hunt, Defra's joint Chief Digital Officers, restated what 'digital' was originally intended to mean. Their post [what we mean by "digital"](https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/11/13/what-we-mean-by-digital/) returned to source and quoted Tom Loosemore's orginal defintion: 

> "Digital: Applying the culture, practices, processes & technologies of the Internet-era to respond to people's raised expectations."

Harriett and Myra highlight an important aspect of this definition of digital: 

> "The first 3 of those are about how we do things. About the ways that people work."**

Technology is the smallest aspect of 'digital'. The implication being that the bulk of a digital team's time should be spent improving how we do things and the way we work. Conversely, if our focus is purely on technology then we should call ourselves a technology team.

This deeper understanding of the work 'digital' is helpful because it points towards the need to understand how organisations change how they do things and the way they work. Tom Loosemore's original definition of 'digital' can be seen as a summary of existing good practice in effective organisational change, strapped to a mission to change the way that the public interacts with the state. I've previously been involved in [digital transformation of the charity sector](https://scottcolfer.com/2015/07/23/empathy-and-digital-transformation.html) and used great research by people like Julie Dodd's [The New Reality](https://thenewreality.info/) to help me understand that changing and improving an organisation requires investment in people, processess, tools (including technology), and mindset.

'Digital' seems to imply a mission (something like improving the relationship between users and an organisation) via a couple of methods (user-centred design, and organisational change concepts like those outlined in Julie Dodd's research). Conversely, digital is not simply better technolgy. 

**3. #deliveryisthestrategy** 

‘Delivery is the strategy’ was the rallying call of digital transformation in government for the longest time. The truth is that ‘delivery is the strategy’ is a tactic. It’s something used at the beginning of digital transformation to build an organisation’s emotional confidence in a new way of working. This rallying call is often interpretted as ‘the delivery of stuff is the strategy’, because ‘stuff’ gives everyone confidence that things are happening. This is often critical for the first 1-2 years of digital transformation, generating opportunities for the digital pipeline and demonstrating to colleagues that digital teams can be trusted with work. However, this approach quickly build up a lot of stuff that needs to demonstrate return on investment through real outcomes. It then needs to be supported and maintained and we have to figure out models for ongoing funding and continual improvement. It’s not uncommon to suddenly find too much work in progress and less return on investment than planned, with issues quickly arising.

If 'delivery is the strategy' is internally acknowledged as a tactic to support growth during years 0-2 of a new digital team then it can be healthy. 
If 'delivery is the strategy' is then refined to mean 'delivery of outcomes is the strategy' then it can become a means for working with agility at scale (if applied to all levels of the organisation).
If 'delivery is the strategy' is interpreted as 'do a lot of stuff' then it might not be a great strategy.

### Leadership 3.0: Complexity

All organisations are networks and modern leadership is about people and their relationships. This means that we need to view our complex organisations like living organisms. As the Lean Enterprise says, the biggest challenge faced by leaders and managers in complex enterprises is this: ‘How do we help people within our organisation to make good decisions (i.e. to act in the best interests of our organisation) given that they can never have sufficient information and context to understand the full consequences of their decisions, and given that events often overtake our plans?".

The answer is that we need to replace leadership based in old hierarchies with leadership that embraces the complexity of our complext organisations. I've most commonly heard this described as [systems thinking](http://www.thinking.net/Systems_Thinking/OverviewSTarticle.pdf). However Jurgen Appelo takes this a step further and describes this as [complex systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system), with systems thinking being just one way of trying to understand complex systems. Other techniques highlighted by Jurgen include system dynamics, social complexity, and complexity thinking. 

Over the last few years I've been re-training myself to be as interested in complex organisations as I am in the problems spaces that my products operate within. I've only scratched the surface of complex systems theory but it's already helped to on the road to becoming a better leader. Improving my undertanding of complex systems theory is one of my main learning and development objectives in 2019-20.

## Mission command

If understanding complex human systems is the foundation of modern leadership then [mission command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_command) is the framework for actually leading. Mission command is a way of providing leadership in situations where leaders can never have total information and don't have the capacity to make all important decisions without slowing down their entire organisation to their own pace. Organisations that exercise leadership through mission command build strong teams with mutual trust and set missions with clear intent, creating a shared understanding. This enables disciplined initiative that allows people and teams to respond to change and to each other, and to make informed decisions as needed. This is in contrast to the old hierarchies exmplified in command and control organisations. Command and control can work when you have high confidence in the problem you're solving, high confidence in the solution, strong product/market fit, and negligibly changes in conditions. I have seen it work for short amounts of time in small organisations with a single product and a small team but this is rare. 

Mission command was developed in the military and so I've looked to the insights of military professionals to help me better understand it. I particularly enjoyed 'Five reflections on building a misson command culture' [part 1](https://thearmyleader.co.uk/five-rules-of-thumb-to-build-a-mission-command-culture-part-1/) and [part 2](https://thearmyleader.co.uk/five-rules-of-thumb-to-build-a-mission-command-culture-part-2/), which shared 5 principles needed for mission command to work:

1. make sure you have a vision
2. overcommunicate clarity, at least 2 levels down
3. delegate until you feel uncomfortable and then delegate some more
4. to encourage hones views, start by asking the most junior opinion and then work your way up the group
5. treat other teams as if they are part of your team.

For me, the way to counter the 'agile at scale' meme is to develop a mission command culture. Working with agility means focussing on outcomes over outputs, and releasing stuff early and often to check you're getting the outcomes you want. 'Agile at scale' means all teams do this, at all levels of the organisation. Mission command gives a general approach to working with agility at scale without the requirement to commit to a detailed methodology like LeSS or SAFe. Once again: these methodologies can be useful - but a lot of work would need to be undertaken before understanding enough about an organisation to judge whether these are right for them. 

If I can recommend a single book to read in order to understand mission command and how it can work in a large enterprise then it would be [Lean Enterprise](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030355.do) by Barry O'Reilly et al. I've read it a couple of times over the last few years, directly implementing some of its suggestions at work, and exploring some concepts in more depth as part of my professional development.

## Leadership dimensions

Let's pause. 
This is a lot, right? We're still working on general leadership. We haven't even got to the specifics of product leadership. 
How do we keep all of this in mind in a practical way, day to day?

Georg was developing a model to help balance the different dimensions of leadership in 2017, at the same time as we working have coaching sessions together. This meant that I got to use it and feedback on early versions of it. Georg finalised and published his mode in 2018, you can see it in this [post](https://georgfasching.com/introducing-the-prime-leadership-model/). I've taken the model and [tweaked it to fit my needs](https://scottcolfer.com/2018/01/29/leadership-dimensions.html). It's helped me to think of five dimensions to leadership that I need to balance at all times:

**1. My self**

I am not my job. My work is not my life. My partner, my family, my friends, my interests and my hobbies are the main focus of my life. My job and the mission of my organisation (my work life) are really important to me but my partner, my family, my friends, my interests and my hobbies (my real life) are more important to me.

It's possible to carry a lot as a leader. Stress can build up. We can burn out. Our mental health can suffer. I've personally found it helpful to train myself to realise that work life is less important than real life. Taking breaks from work to rest my brain, and focussing on my partner, friends and family in my real life has the side benefit of making me much more effective when I'm at work. This [article](https://hbr.org/2017/12/break-the-cycle-of-stress-and-distraction-by-using-your-emotional-intelligence) in the Harvard Business Review by Kandi Wiens is a short exploration of these concepts.

**2. People**

Our organisation are complex systems of people. People (including ourselves) are the most important part of most organisations we'll work for. People are at the heart of transforming how we build and run our products. Mike Bracken attributed the early successes of the Government Digital Service to bringing the right people into government. In an [article](https://www.themandarin.com.au/67749-podcast-mike-bracken-on-reforming-an-institution-from-within-using-internet-era-skills/?pgnc=1&pgnc=1?pgnc=1&pgnc=1) from 2016, Mike says: 

> "we hired insanely talented internet-era technologists and gave them a chance to change government, and the great thing about them is they move at such pace. They move so quickly that they can deliver in the time it takes to have the meeting to discuss whether to do the thing in the first place. And they did, time and again.”

I find that lots of product leaders get into leadership through this dimension. We're asked to manage a couple of product managers. Then a few. Then one day we're responsible for all the recruitment, performance management, and pastoral care for our entire profession. I think that 'people' is often the aspect of leadership that we're most comfortable with.

I've found two things to be particularly useful in developing my leadership skills in relation to people:

- [Building Successful Communities of Practice](https://emilywebber.co.uk/building-successful-communities-of-practice/) by Emily Webber has helped me to design a product management profession that supports and develops approx. 50 product managers at various stages of the career pathway, across multiple locations in the UK. I've been using the book since it was published in 2016 and hired Emily to work directly with me and my profession to us design our community of practice.
- [Performance Coaching](https://scottcolfer.com/2013/11/20/great-businesses-grow-from-conversations.html) is the skill that I use most often in my professional life. I'm a trained, non-directive performance coach. I assume that the head that holds a problem often holds the solution. I help people by listening to them, and asking non-directive questions to help them find their solution. It sad how few occassions we get to speak and be genuinely listened to, but amazing how effective it can be for helping us to figure something out. I highly recommend both being coached and learning how to coach.

**3. Organisational improvement**

It's important for leaders to commit to improving their organisation.  Leaders must continuously work to simplify processes and business complexity, to increase the effectiveness, autonomy and capabilities of teams. At the same time, there's a limit to how much we can do. I've nearly burned myself out a couple of times trying to improve an organisation on my own. Government, for example, is too big to be saved by one person. I've learned over time that as long as I'm always foccussed one improving one aspect of my organisation then I'm doing my job. I've stopped starting lots of things and switched to finishing things. Doing one thing at a time is the best way to see something through to a genuine result.

nearly burnt myself out by trying to improve everything at once but govt is too big to be 'saved' by one person. Do one thing at a time. Even a single bit of one dept can have enough problems to lead to burnout for someone drive by perfection and unrelenting standards. Prioritise the most valuable thing. Focus on finishing over starting.

I've been using a cycle of organisational improvement for the last few years, known as the [improvement kata](https://www.lean.org/Workshops/WorkshopDescription.cfm?WorkshopId=68) and popularised by Toyota. The four steps are:

Planning:

1. Understand the direction of change, often derived from the vision set by the leadership (which should be inspiring and potentially unobtainable in practice). 
2. Grasp the current condition. Understand and benchmark the current condition
3. Establish the target condition. Identify the aspect of the organisation being addressed, the date by which you want to reach the target condition, and pass/fail criteria by which to judge success.

Execution:

4. Iterate towards the target condition using a [plan-do-check-act cycle](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_89.htm), series of experiments to achieve (trust people to run experiments and react quickly, not plan all action in advance)

The organisation is your team. It's not 'the business', it's our organisation. It's just large and complicated. Need to be as interested in organising large organisation as you are in the problem space of your product(s).

**4. Time**

-- design sprints. we should design our time as well as we design our products.
-- an interesting one. Used to take this narrowly as 'we all have limited time in the day'. Now understand that it's broader than that: things take time. Took 2-3 years to develop as product leader. Took 1-2 years before I could start delegating in earnest.

**5. Value management**

-- our USP, where a lot of product leadership sits
-- art of business value


Make all of this work visible in leadership plans; not just delivery work

# Chapter 2: Product leadership

Previously took identity from 'hands-on' product management - worried at loss of product management when moving into 'managing people'.

A team is a team.

Just product manager for management and leadership teams. And they are interesting. Maybe don't conform to your expectations of teams.
Maybe not that multidisciplinary, and not used to specialists.

Trying to introduce this to management teams https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/

Digital is . . . 
Tends to only focus on technology
Product interested in the others
Product is a business function, not a technology function
Digital transformation is change of all the above

Symptom of the above: tech startups or previously tech teams (ass we're often in in govt) might better understand technology profession - so may be more open to Chief Technology officer/technology leadership than product leadership. Might need to hit a problem before value of the profession is seen (e.g. Financial Times - or once it's a certain age and is judged by outcomes, not outputs).

You are the product manager for a management team. Product is a busines function, not a technology function. Meliss Perri tweet.
- 'do you mind that you're just managing people?' What are you doing now? Product managers don't do anything, we think and we talk. The job is always about people.
- 'don't you need to stay 'hands-on'? Otherwise you'll lose your skils'. You are hands-on. You're simply the product manager for your management team. You do everything you did in a propudct team, just adapted for a management team
Different to product team. Often may have basic understanding of working with agility. Don't spend much time together so takes a long time to build trust and performance (not co-located, rarely multi-disciplinary, often limited face-to-face time).
Equivalent of a user story at leadership level: opportunity outline
Senior product manager = associate product leader
- when I began my role, the disucssion was simply 'how many products can we get a senior to manage?'

Have to be as interested in your organisation as you are in your users.
