Focus on burnout, end of 2016

# Context

Based on total experience to date.
Currently in large enterprise.
Specialist leadership.
This guide will be more or less relevant for other contexts.

# Leadership, generally

Agile at scale. Agile at scale literally means working with agility, at scale. Don't get seduced by less, safe, etc. They may be useful down the line but there's years of work needed in the leadership space to get to a space where you know enough to decide that one of these frameworks fits your organisation. MOJ Digital tried scrum of scums years ago. Didn't work and was quietly abandoned.
Agile leadership is achieved through mission control. 
Lean Enterprise
- do you have buy-in for mission control?
-- Janice Fraser, buy-in

Five reflections on building a misson command culture [part 1](https://thearmyleader.co.uk/five-rules-of-thumb-to-build-a-mission-command-culture-part-1/) and [part 2](https://thearmyleader.co.uk/five-rules-of-thumb-to-build-a-mission-command-culture-part-2/):

- make sure you have a vision
- overcommunicate clarity, at least 2 levels down
- delegate until you feel uncomfortable and then delegate some more
- to encourage hones views, start by asking the most junior opinion and then work your way up the group
- treat other teams as if they are part of your team.


Have to be as interested in your organisation as you have previously been in a single team. It's not 'stakeholders', it's colleagues.  The organisation is your team. It's not 'the business', it's our organisation. It's just large and complicated. Need to be as interested in organising large organisation as you are in the problem space of your product(s).

Often described as 'seeing the bigger picture' but left no more defined that this.
Mind the Product (?) suggests that systems thinking is a growth area for development for product leaders. 
Management 3.0 by Jurgen Appelo takes this a step further and describes this as complex sytems theory (chapter 3), with systems thinking being just one way of trying to understand complex systems. There are mutliple models, each of which has inspired multiple techniques. _Systems thinking referred to on p49_ 
Seeing the bigger picture includes learning from others. Look sideways.

Value of coaching
Georg's model: leadership dimensions
- my self
-- easy to carry a lot
- people
-- often where we first get into leadership
-- coaching; community of practice; role description; skills; career pathway; define in relation to others; handbook; etc
- organisational improvement
- value management
- time

Make all of this work visible in leadership plans; not just delivery work

# Product leadership
You are the product manager for a management team. Product is a busines function, not a technology function. Meliss Perri tweet.
- 'do you mind that you're just managing people?' What are you doing now? Product managers don't do anything, we think and we talk. The job is always about people.
- 'don't you need to stay 'hands-on'? Otherwise you'll lose your skils'. You are hands-on. You're simply the product manager for your management team. You do everything you did in a propudct team, just adapted for a management team
Different to product team. Often may have basic understanding of working with agility. Don't spend much time together so takes a long time to build trust and performance (not co-located, rarely multi-disciplinary, often limited face-to-face time).
Equivalent of a user story at leadership level: opportunity outline
Senior product manager = associate product leader
- when I began my role, the disucssion was simply 'how many products can we get a senior to manage?'
