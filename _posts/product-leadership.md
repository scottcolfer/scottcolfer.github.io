# Prologue

It's December 2016. People keep asking me if I'm OK. One of them is Georg, our executive coach. We chat in the kitchen. After a pause he says  "Scott, are you OK? You look exhausted." From behind tired eyes I let him know what's on my plate. In the last 12-months I've shifted from Senior Product Manager to Lead Product Manager. And then to unofficial Head of Product.  I'm  managing 15 product managers. I'm also managing a couple of Web Operations Engineers for good measure. I've just completed five simultaneous recruitment campaigns. And remain hands-on product manager for two teams. This was  too much for one person to do. I was burned-out.

Georg suggests I make time to have a chat with him to see if we  improve things. A few days later we meet in the week before the  Christmas break. And so began my real development as a product leader.

# Introduction

There’s plenty of guidance and training on product management. There's little on product leadership. And common to many of my peers,  I've never had a product leader responsible for my support and development. This has led to lots of self-motivated digging, trial, and error.

I've also found that  product leadership roles can be misunderstood  and under-used.  Senior and Lead  Product Manager can sometimes mean ‘busy product manager’, in  practice.  ‘Head of Product’ can sometimes mean ‘glorified people manager’ in practice.  

We need to figure out what product leadership means and explain it to our colleagues asap. No pressure.  This post summarises my attempts to do these two things.

# Chapter 1: Leadership

Following our chat in the kitchen, I have leadership coaching sessions with Georg in 2017.  The first thing I wanted to figure out was what good leadership look like in 2019. I wanted a handle on general leadership before getting stuck-in to product leadership.

Georg recommended I read [Management 3.0](https://jurgenappelo.com/management-30/)  by Jurgen Appelo. This book helped me define the type of leader I  want to be. It also helped me define the kind of leadership I want to avoid. It comes  highly recommended. The short version is that modern leaders need the ability to do the right thing and do the thing right in the midst of complexity. They need to avoid hierarchical leadership  and meme leadership. 

Let's explore this further. 

### Leadership 1.0: Old hierarchies

Organisations designed around hierarchies  are managed in a top-down fashion. Power is in the hands of the few. People at the bottom have little money, few responsibilities, and  little motivation to do a good job. This is often described as  'command-and-control'. It is often mistakenly likened to a  military-style structur. In reality, the military abandoned this approach  many decades ago. This type of leadership can function in conditions of  high-certainty and low-change. It is poorly suited to conditions of  low-certainity and high-change. The organisation's workflow is dicated by the capacity of the small number of people allowed to make decisions.

The Government of the United Kingdom is around 800 years old. IBut times, they are a-changing. The [information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age)  has seen massive and rapid change. The relationship between the public and Government in the UK has irrevocably changed. The public has  with much higher expectations of public services today than was the case in the past. The UK's Civil Service  is undergoing significant change to keep-pace with this change. The  Chief Executive of the Civil Service has challenged Civil Service  leaders to leave old hierarchies behind and embrace a new type of  leadership. In his [Civil Service Transformation speach](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/civil-service-transformation-speech) in early 2018 John Manzoni said: 

> "We need leaders with empathy, who can manage their teams through  transformation and encourage continuous improvement. Leaders with  broader experience, who are effective in a complex, multidisciplinary  world, who lead with their hearts and their guts, as well as their  heads, who see the big picture. Leaders whose instincts - developed  through experience - are collaborative; who are used to working across  boundaries, confident beyond their own professional area, and inspire  and empower their teams."

I need to avoid command-and-control leadership. Instead, I need to aspire to emapthetic, collaborate, empowering leadership. This will help build  an organisation that can respond quickly to change.

### Leadership 2.0: Meme leadership 

 There are a  lot of leadership fads.  To summarise and paraphrase Jurgen Appelo, they act as  add-ons for hierarchical organisations.  Thse fads ease the problems of an organisation without fundamentally changing leadership.  He gives Six Sigma as one example. This is 'leadership 2.0'. It is leadership 1.0 (old hierarchies) with add-ons to release pressure built up within an old system. 

I like the word 'fad' but think 'meme' works even better. Simon Wardley  has used the word 'meme' to describe leadership strategy, and it's  stuck with me. 'Meme' is more forgiving than 'fad'. A fad is a  'trivial fancy adopted for a while with irrational zeal'. A meme is 'a unit of cultural information that is transmitted from one mind to  another through repeated action. The cultural information that starts a  meme may be valuable but this value may be lessened through repeated  transmission.' 

I'm about to list some common leadership memes. Each meme has a core concept that is valuable. But their repeated transmission has forgotten this core concept. In extreme concept, repeated sharing changes them until they oppose their initial meaning. Here's my top-3 leadership memes :)

**1. #agileatscale**

I'm going to stick my neck out and say that, for me, working with  agility means two things. One: focus on outcomes over  outputs. Two: release stuff early and often to check you're  getting the outcomes you want. There's more to the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)  than my reductive summary. Let's assume that my  summary leaves gaps. The point is that working with  agility is based on simplicity. And simplicity is hard.

'Agile at scale' has emerged as a concept in the last few years. At  its heart, it's a great concept. It implies they following:
'OK folks. Our product teams have focused on outcomes for users for a few years now. It's improved the value of our products and services. Let's do the same thing with our management teams. And let's all have a common understanding of the value of our products so we're aiming towards the same goal.' 
Simple principles, hard to achieve.

Sometimes these principles are missed. 'Agile at scale' becomes 'find a framework to link our product teams'. A framework, like Large-Scale Scrum ('[LeSS](https://less.works/)') or the Scaled Agile Framework ('[SAFe](https://www.scaledagile.com/)'),  is lifted and shifted onto an organisation.  But the organisation doesn't change any of its fundamental management structures. The framework becomes an  add-on to prop-up an old, hierarchical organisation. I've worked for a large enterprise that adopted [scrum of scrums](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum-of-scrums/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'scrum*20of*20scrums))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)). The organisation lacked a functional value proposition. There was no transformation of the portfolio or management team. The product teams had disparate goals and users. They weren't all suited to scrum. The experiment failed and was quietly dropped after a few months. I've shared this experience with a few folks over the  years. Periodically I receive a message saying something like, 'my leadership team  is about to adopt Less/Safe/etc. It's going to be a car crash. How do I  help them to stop before it's too late?'. The struggle is real. 

 This isn't a dig at either of  those frameworks. They can be great. But they're component of an organisation's designs. Not the design itself.  Working with agility means focusing on outcomes over  outputs. It also means releasing stuff early and often to check you're getting the  outcomes you want. If every level of your organisation is doing this then you're working with agility at scale.

**2. #digitaltransformation**

Be honest. Do you really know what you mean when you tell people that you 'work in digital?' And do you think anyone else understands what it means? Be honest. Think of those glazed eyes at in the pub, at parties and family gatherings. The opaque nature of the word 'digital' was recently criticised by UK Government's Science and Technology Select Committee's [Digital Government inquiry](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/digital-government-17-19/). Their [report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/1455/145510.htm) concluded that the open-ended definition of "digital" made it difficult to assess progress made by the digital agenda.

So wtf does 'digital' mean? Harriett Green and Myra Hunt, Defra's joint Chief Digital Officers, restated what 'digital' was intended to mean. Their post [what we mean by "digital"](https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/11/13/what-we-mean-by-digital/) returned to source and quoted Tom Loosemore's original defintion: 

> "Digital: Applying the culture, practices, processes & technologies of the Internet-era to respond to people's raised expectations."

Harriett and Myra highlight an important aspect of this definition of digital: 

> "The first 3 of those are about how we do things. About the ways that people work."

Technology is the smallest aspect of 'digital'.  We should call ourselves technology teams if our focus is purely technology. We earn the name 'digital' when we also improve practices, processes, and our culture. Tom Loosemore's definition of  'digital' summarises research into effective organisational change. I've supported [digital transformation of the charity sector](https://scottcolfer.com/2015/07/23/empathy-and-digital-transformation.html). Research like [The New Reality](https://thenewreality.info/) by Julie Dodd helped me understand that organisational change is complex. Improving an organisation requires investment in people, processess, tools (including technology), and mindset.

'Digital transformation' seems to mean a mission and a method. The mission is probably improving the relationship between users and an organisation. The method is probably improvement of people, processes, tools, and mindset. Technology is one component of digital transformation.

**3. #deliveryisthestrategy** 

‘Delivery is the strategy’ was the rallying call for digital  transformation in government. The truth is that  ‘delivery is the strategy’ is a tactic. It’s used at the  beginning of digital transformation. It's an effective way to build a host organisation’s emotional confidence in a new way of working. This is critical for the first 1-2 years of digital transformation. Growing confidence through tangible software generates new opportunities. This builds a pipeline of work.

This approach builds up a lot of stuff that needs done. And the goal shifts from simply building it, to demonstrating its value. We have to demonstrate return on investment, not just demo software.  It’s not uncommon to find ourselves with too much work  in progress. And less return on investment than planned. And let's not mention the headache of supporting and maintaining live software.

'Delivery [of stuff] is the strategy' can be a useful tactic for promoting growth of a new digital team. Refining it to become 'delivery [of outcomes] is the strategy' is necessary after a couple of years.

### Leadership 3.0: Complexity

All organisations are networks and modern leadership is about people  and their relationships. This means that we need to view our complex  organisations like living organisms. The Lean Enterprise poses the following question:
 
‘How do we help people within our organisation to make good  decisions (i.e. to act in the best interests of our organisation) given  that they can never have sufficient information and context to  understand the full consequences of their decisions, and given that  events often overtake our plans?".

The answer is that we need to replace leadership based in old  hierarchies. Instead we need leadership that embraces the complexity of our organisations. This is often described as [systems thinking](http://www.thinking.net/Systems_Thinking/OverviewSTarticle.pdf). Jurgen Appelo takes this a step further and describes this as [complex systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system).  Systems thinking being is just one way of trying to understand  complex systems. Other techniques highlighted by Jurgen include system  dynamics, social complexity, and complexity thinking.

I've been re-training myself to be as  interested in my complex organisation as I am in my products. I've only scratched the surface of complex systems theory. But it's already helped me on the road to becoming a  better leader. Improving my undertanding of complex systems theory is  one of my main learning and development objectives in 2019-20.

## Mission command

[Mission command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_command)  is the framework for actually leading within a complex organisation.  Mission command allows leadership in situations where leaders can never have total information. And don't have the capacity to make all decisions for their organisation. 
Organisations that exercise leadership through mission command build  strong teams with mutual trust. They set missions with clear intent,  creating a shared understanding. They encourage disciplined initiative. This allows people and teams to respond to change and  to make informed decisions. 

Mission command contrasts with command and control. Command and  control can work when you have high confidence in the problem you're  solving and high confidence in your solution. It requires strong product/market fit and negligible changes in conditions. I have seen it work for short amounts  of time in small organisations but this is rare.

Mission command was developed in the military. I've looked to  the insights of military professionals to help me better understand it. I  particularly enjoyed 'Five reflections on building a misson command  culture' [part 1](https://thearmyleader.co.uk/five-rules-of-thumb-to-build-a-mission-command-culture-part-1/) and [part 2](https://thearmyleader.co.uk/five-rules-of-thumb-to-build-a-mission-command-culture-part-2/), which shared 5 principles needed for mission command to work:

1. make sure you have a vision
2. overcommunicate clarity, at least 2 levels down
3. delegate until you feel uncomfortable and then delegate some more
4. to encourage hones views, start by asking the most junior opinion and then work your way up the group
5. treat other teams as if they are part of your team.

The 'agile at scale' meme can be countered by development of a mission command culture.  Mission command gives a  general approach to working with agility at scale. It does this without imposing a detailed methodology like LeSS or SAFe. [Lean Enterprise](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030355.do) by Barry O'Reilly et al is a great book to read on this topic. It explains what mission command looks like in a large enterprise. I've directly implemented severl of its suggestions in my day job. Other concepts have been explored as part of my professional development.

## Leadership dimensions

Let's pause. This is a lot, right? We're still working on general leadership. We haven't even got to the specifics of product leadership. How do we keep all of this in mind in a practical way, day to day?

Let's return to Georg, the coach I worked with during 2017. Georg developed a model to help balance the many dimensions of leadership. He developed it during the year we worked together. This meant that I got to use it and feedback on early  versions of it. I've found it helpful over the last few years. Georg finalised and published his mode in 2018, you can see it in this [post](https://georgfasching.com/introducing-the-prime-leadership-model/). I've taken the model and [tweaked it to fit my needs](https://scottcolfer.com/2018/01/29/leadership-dimensions.html). It's helped me to think of five dimensions to leadership that I need to balance at all times:

**1. My self**

I am not my job. My work is not my life. My partner, my family, my  friends, my interests and my hobbies are the main focus of my life. My  job and the mission of my organisation (my work life) are important to me. But my partner, my family, my friends, my interests and my hobbies (my real life) are more important to me. It's possible to carry a lot as a leader. Stress can build up. We can  burn out. Our mental health can suffer. I've found it  helpful to train myself to realise that work life is less important than  real life. 

Taking breaks from work to rest my brain is important. Making time to focus on  my partner, friends and family in my real life has the side benefit of  making me much more effective when I'm at work. This [article](https://hbr.org/2017/12/break-the-cycle-of-stress-and-distraction-by-using-your-emotional-intelligence) in the Harvard Business Review by Kandi Wiens explores these concepts.

**2. People**

Our organisation are complex systems of people. People (including ourselves) are the most important part of most organisations we'll work for. People are at the heart of transforming how we build and run our products. Mike Bracken attributed the early successes of the Government Digital Service to bringing the right people into government. In an [article](https://www.themandarin.com.au/67749-podcast-mike-bracken-on-reforming-an-institution-from-within-using-internet-era-skills/?pgnc=1&pgnc=1?pgnc=1&pgnc=1) from 2016, Mike says: 

> "we hired insanely talented internet-era technologists and gave them a chance to change government, and the great thing about them is they move at such pace. They move so quickly that they can deliver in the time it takes to have the meeting to discuss whether to do the thing in the first place. And they did, time and again.”

I find that lots of product leaders get into leadership through this dimension. We're asked to manage a couple of product managers. Then a few. Then one day we're responsible for all the recruitment, performance management, and pastoral care for our entire profession. I think that 'people' is often the aspect of leadership that we're most comfortable with.

I've found two things to be particularly useful in developing my leadership skills in relation to people:

- [Building Successful Communities of Practice](https://emilywebber.co.uk/building-successful-communities-of-practice/) by Emily Webber has helped me to design a product management profession that supports and develops approx. 50 product managers at various stages of the career pathway, across multiple locations in the UK. I've been using the book since it was published in 2016 and hired Emily to work directly with me and my profession to us design our community of practice.
- [Performance Coaching](https://scottcolfer.com/2013/11/20/great-businesses-grow-from-conversations.html) is the skill that I use most often in my professional life. I'm a trained, non-directive performance coach. I assume that the head that holds a problem often holds the solution. I help people by listening to them, and asking non-directive questions to help them find their solution. It sad how few occassions we get to speak and be genuinely listened to, but amazing how effective it can be for helping us to figure something out. I highly recommend both being coached and learning how to coach.

**3. Organisational improvement**

It's important for leaders to commit to improving their organisation. We need to be as interested in improving our organisation as we are in our problems. We need to get over the urge to use the phrase 'the business': we can't get away with calling colleagues and teams in the same organisation 'the business'. We should refer to them as 'colleagues' and recognise that they're in our organisation. Not 'the business'. Leaders must continuously work to simplify processes and business complexity, to increase the effectiveness, autonomy and capabilities of teams. 

At the same time, there's a limit to how much we can do. I've nearly burned myself out a couple of times trying to improve an organisation on my own. John Cutlefish has written a post about the perils of [seeing lots of problems in your organisation and trying to solve them all](https://cutle.fish/blog/the-canary-dies) Government, for example, is too big to be saved by one person. I've learned over time that as long as I'm always foccussed one improving one aspect of my organisation then I'm doing my job. I've stopped starting lots of things and switched to finishing things. Doing one thing at a time is the best way to see something through to a genuine result.

nearly burnt myself out by trying to improve everything at once but govt is too big to be 'saved' by one person. Do one thing at a time. Even a single bit of one dept can have enough problems to lead to burnout for someone drive by perfection and unrelenting standards. Prioritise the most valuable thing. Focus on finishing over starting.

I've been using a cycle of organisational improvement for the last few years, known as the [improvement kata](https://www.lean.org/Workshops/WorkshopDescription.cfm?WorkshopId=68) and popularised by Toyota. The four steps are:

Planning:

- Understand the direction of change, often derived from the vision set by the leadership (which should be inspiring and potentially unobtainable in practice). 
- Grasp the current condition. Understand and benchmark the current condition
- Establish the target condition. Identify the aspect of the organisation being addressed, the date by which you want to reach the target condition, and pass/fail criteria by which to judge success.

Execution:

- Iterate towards the target condition using a [plan-do-check-act cycle](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_89.htm), series of experiments to achieve (trust people to run experiments and react quickly, not plan all action in advance).

**4. Time**

This is intersting. I used to take this narrowly just to mean 'we all have the same time in the day', and so we need to prioritise our time. 
This is true: we do need to prioritise our time. [The Design Sprint](https://www.thesprintbook.com/) by Jake Knapp is about the importance of prioritising time. On the surface, it's a book about a particular method of kicking-off work by have an intensely planned and organised week of activity. Look a little deeper, and it's about the general need to design our time as well as we design our products. I heard Jake speak at the [2017 London Mind the Product Conference](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/09/design-sprints-jake-knapp/) where he said that what he was exploring in the book and the specific model of the design sprint was the need for us to recognise the value of our time. We have rigorous sprints to plan our work - and then undermine them by having all manner of meetings eat away at our time. We have to justify all the work in a backlog to, but treat our time as infinite and agree to all sorts of time-sucks without question. The takeaway: design our time as well as we design our products.

I've also come to realise that things take time. Sometimes the key to success is leaving enough time for them. I've never witnessed real, positive change in a large, complex organisation in less than 6 months. It's often closer to 1-2 years. I've never witnessed a new team approach high-performance in less than 2-3 months. It might take 6 momths. And that's if it's a genuinely co-located, multidisciplinary team. Patience and persistence and are often the crucial and and overlooked ingredients for success. Things take time. 

**5. Value**

This is the ultimate test of our leadership. 
Are our products and services valuable for our users? Is that value increasing over time because of our leadership?
Everything we do should be geared towards this dimension of leadership. Value is the most critical aspect of working with agility. It’s the focus of the first of the [principles behind the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html): 'Our highest priority is to satisfy the customerthrough early and continuous deliveryof valuable [software].'

However.

Working with agility makes the promise of focussing on value but then witholds the means by which to define value. The Agile Manifesto gives us nothing to help figure out what value is. Subsequent frameworks like Scrum also neglect to help us figure out what value is. Most guides seem to assume that ‘value’ is figured out somewhere else by ‘the business’ then presented to delivery teams in a fully-formed stated to be consumed and acted upon. In reality, it’s often the case that ‘the business’ is waiting for delivery teams to present their defintion of value. And so we can end up in a space where we’re all delivering ‘stuff’ early and often without an honest sense of whether it’s truly valuable. This can feed the #deliveryisthestrategy meme. 

We can switch from delivering 'stuff' to delivering valuable outcomes. We need to define the value proposition for our organisation. We need to define the value of the service(s) we offer. We need to set missions that measure improvement to this value. Sounds a lot like product management, right? Yes it does. Product leadership is just product management put to work in a management team. Managing value is the specialism of product managers. And so this leadership dimension is where product leadership comes to life. Product leaders are uniquely placed to shape this leadership dimension for their organisation. Our specialist skill is to take the insights of multiple, specialist perspectives and to find value in the sweetspot where they align. We learn this as product managers within product teams. Our challenge and opportunity as product leaders is to take everything we've learned and tweak it to work at a larger scale, within a management team.

---

My assumption is that product leadership takes the skills required to lead in a large, complex organisation and filters them through the [product management skills](https://scottcolfer.com/product-management-handbook/) we've learned working in product teams. Product leaders are just product managers in management teams. Ultimately, a team is a team. Working as a product manager in a product team has given us the skills we need to work as a product manager in a leadership team. Yes, we need to adapt them to a new context. But fundamentally our specialism remains the same: taking the insights of multiple, specialist perspectives and to find value in the sweetspot where they align. The way we do this remains them same: building the value proposition for our organisation; defining the value of the product(s)/service(s) we offer; and setting missions that measure improvement to this value. 

I've shared my personal definition of 'general' leadership in chapter 1:

- I'm working in a large, complex organisation so am focussing on this context
- leaders must be capable of understanding complex systems
- leaders must help people in their organisation to make good decisions in conditions where they can never have sufficient information and context to understand the full consequences of their decisions, and given that events often overtake plans
- leaders can achieve this through mission command: building strong teams with mutual trust and setting outcome-driven missions with clear intent, and creating a shared understanding of missions. This enables disciplined initiative that allows people and teams to respond to change and to each other, and to make informed decisions as needed
- leadership consists of five dimensions: 1. Ourself; 2. People; 3. Organisational improvement; 4. Time; 5. Value
- product leaders are uniquely placed within their organisation to lead on value.

In chapter 2 I've shared my emerging thinking about the specifics of product leadership:

- the differences between product teams and management teams
- adapting product management skills learned in product teams so that they work in management teams
- value at an organisational level.

# Chapter 2: Product leadership

Product managers often ask me a question: 'do you mainly manage people now you're a head of product?' My answer is 'yes . . . that's what you do, right?'. When I was a product manager in a produc team, I managed people. I didn't build the product or design the product. I managed other people, bringing the insights of specialists together. I brought together the insights from specialists and looked for value in the sweetspot where they aligned. I managed people. There's a lot of anxietyt amongst product leaders worried that they need to remain 'hands-on' in a product team or they'll lose their product management skills.  What I've learned is that this is a comfort blanket. Product leaders are simply product managers for a management team. We're hands-on in our management team. We do everything we used to do in product teams but adapt it to work at a larger scale. A team is a team. We're simply taking what worked in a product team and adapting it to work in a leadership team.

## What's the difference between a product team and a management team?

Management teams are interesting. If you're used to working with co-located, multi-disciplinary specialists then a management team might not conform to your expectations of what a team is. 

Management teams may be monodisciplinary or new to being multidisciplinary. Product teams have understood the value of multidisciplinary team members for quite some time. Lizzie Bruce has written a helpful post about [why multidisciplinary teams are good](https://blog.prototypr.io/why-multi-disciplinary-teams-are-good-1e3ed930ea21) with the healthcare sector carrying out great research on the value of multidisciplinary teams and their effect on things like [breast cancer survival](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/344/bmj.e2718.full.pdf). Specialists joining management teams may find that they are joining generalist leaders, who are responsible for the entirity of organisational silo (along with everything that happens in that organisational silo). This is often known as 'line management', i.e. everyone has a single management line that leads into a single, generalist leader. This is the 'old hierarchy' that Jurgen Appelo referred to as management 1.0. Specialist's with cross-cutting responsibility for a profession that spans multuple silos is effectively the introduction of [matrix management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management), in which management of an organisation becomes a collaborative effort between divisions of the organisation foccussed on tasks (what needs to be achieved), and profession focussed on specialist skills (how). Divisions of the organisation are narrow and deep. Professions are broad and shallow. These two perspectives create a useful tension that keep each other honest. The 'truth' lies somewhere between the two perspectives.

Management teams may be dispersed. Probably across multiple areas of a building. Possibly across a coutntry. Maybe across the world. In relation to co-located product teams, they may spend little time together. Maybe once a fortnight (or less). They may spend even less time together in the real world. This means that it can take management teams significantly longer than co-located product teams to become high-performing. Trust is the bedrock of a high-performing team. Trust takes time, and is accelerated by spending time together in real life. Trust builds safety. Feeling safe makes us more willing to be vulnerable, more willing to constructively challenge our team members, and more willing to accept feedback. Product leaders joining management teams should look for opportunities to learn from the best-performing product teams and to take those lessons to their management team. My experience to date is that guidance on improving performance of product teams is equally useful in improving the performance of management teams. A couple of recommendations include:

- [The Five Dysfuntions of a Team](https://thepowermoves.com/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/) by Patrick Lencioni  has been around for almost a decade and talks about the importance of trust as the bedrock for high-performing teams. This book is not without its critics, who point out that it's not really based on research, more observations and assumptions that're tied together. Read it with a critical mind, but there's some useful stuff in there.
- [The Five Keys to a Successful Google Team](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) by Julia Rozovsky is more recent and more re-search based (abeit within the contraints of Google as an organisation). Psychological safety has been around as a concept for a while and this post from 2015 has helped to popularise it (as often happens when Google writes about something). This post is a good, simple set of principles for any management team to aspire to.

Finally, what's the similar between management teams and product teams? People. Management teams are often full of people who're extremely committed to the mission of our organisation. They're probably operating under the most difficult conditions of all the teams in the organisation. They're possibly at the forefront of all the tensions that with the rest of the organisation, who possible see 'digital' as a fly by night, hipster fad that won't commit to deadlines or explain what people will get for their money. They're possibly the longest-serving members of our organisations, with the deepest insights into what will and what won't work. It's nice to grumble about management teams from a position within a product team but its important to have empathy, trust, and respect. The phrase 'hippo' was used in the product management profession for a few years, an acronym to describe the 'highest paid person's opinion'. The implication was that we shouldn't be solely driven by hippos and this was a reminder to listen to the perspectives of others too. Unfortunately this became a meme that encouraged a culture of entirely discounting the insights of leaders. As product leaders we must remember that we become hippos to some. It's important to remember that [hippos are people too](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/06/remember-hippos-humans/). The way that we speak about members of our management teams will set the tone for how the rest of our profession think of them. We have an opportunity to bulid empathy and increase trust between management teams and product teams. I was freaked-out the first time I was referred to as a 'stakeholder' by a product team. Once I'd got over this initial response I realised that I had the opportunity to reframe the relationship between the product team and the management team, shifting it outside of 'stakeholder management' (i.e. product team tries to make managers happy so they're left alone) and into collaboration (i.e. I have unique knowledge and influence that can help them). Melissa Perri has explored this in her post [what everyone gets wrong about stakeholders](https://melissaperri.com/blog/stakeholders).

## Adapting the skills you've learned in product teams to fit management teams

A management team is fundamentally just another team. We know that management teams and product teams have some superficial differences but they are fundamentally the same. All of the skills we've honed as a product manager in a product team are valuable in management teams with just a few tweaks. I'll list a few product management principles and their tweaks to provide examples but won't exhaustively cover everything. You'll see loads more opportunities to do likewise. The point is that you'll learn almost everything you need to be a good product leader by being a good product manager, a few tweaks is all if takes.

**Product strategy** (how your organisation achieves its business goals) remains valuable. You're now appplying it to a division of an organisation or to an organisation as a whole but you'll use the same tools. You'll still use a [value proposition](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas) but will be applying to the total value of an organisation rather than a single product or service. You'll still use a [business model](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) to optimise costs and improve value but will now be doing it at a larger scale. You'll still use a [vision](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/tips-for-writing-compelling-product-vision/) to describe the improvement in value needed to make all the time, effort, and money worthwhile but not it will need to motivate a lot more people. You'll still need a [roadmap](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2018/09/product-roadmaps-in-five-easy-pieces/) to describe how to get from today (as expressed by your business model) to the future (as expressed by your vision), except now it needs to cover multiple products and services and include the time and money you're investing in organisational improvement.

**Product management tactics** (how you break the strategy down into SMART goals for a team) also remains valuable. User stories are only one way for a product manager to set SMART goals for their team. I took Roman Pichler's Scrum Product Owner training many years ago and he shared that his colleague came up with the 'user story' as a way to help one organisation set SMART goals, and since then it's become another meme that's lost its orginal context. We don't have to express every SMART goal as a user story, we should only use them when useful. This reflection is useful for the product leader. We can set SMART goals in management teams if we think about new ways of expressing why we should do something. Most recently, I've been using the opportunity canvas to help set SMART goals in the management space, specifically to help introduce rigour and accountability to organisational improvement. Organisational improvement is often invisible and often just happens. This makes prioritisation, accountability, and learning difficult. I've started using the following way of expressing SMART goals in management teams around organisational improvement, taken from [Lean Enterprise](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030355.do):

| Section       | Description           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Background**     | Capture the critical information to understand the extent and importance of the problem. Tying the background to the goal statement reduces waste by limiting opportunities to focus on the wrong areas. | 
| **Current condition and problems statement**     | This is the problem the business stakeholder wants to address, in simple understandable terms and not as a lack-of-solution statement. For example, avoid statements like ‘Our problem is we need a Case Management System.’      |
| **Goal statement** | How will we know that our efforts were successful at the end of implementation? Ideally we will need one metric for success. For example, ‘Our goal is to reduce system failures compared to the previous test results of 22 major issues; our target is to reduce this by 20%.’      |
| **Root-cause analysis** | Detail the hypothesis and and assumptions, or a set of experiments performed to test for cause and effect.      |
| **Countermeasures** | List the steps of an experiment to test the hypothesis.      |
| **Check/confirmation effect** | Define a method for assessing if the countermeasures have had an effect.      |
| **Follow-up actions and report** | Identify further steps and share what you have learned with your team or organisation.     |

I'm not suggesting that we now use this way of setting SMART goals for organisational improvement in all cases. Instead, it's more intended to show that we can set SMART goals in all sorts of contexts if we learn tricks beyond user stories. 

**Prioritisation**

Barry Overeem suggested a great way of balancing all of the work needed to optimise a mature product. Barry's [backlog prioritisation quadrant](http://www.barryovereem.com/the-backlog-prioritisation-backlog/) reminds us that all product need new features, improved support, innovation, and architectural innovation to happen throughout their lifetime if their value is to be optimised and their return on investment improved. If we're working in 3-month blocks (for example) then some work will need to happen in all of these areas otherwise our product will deteriorate, and eventually break.

We can take this and apply it at scale. We need to improve our products for our users, improve our relationships with our colleagues, improve how our organisation works, and to pay-down organisational debt each quarter. All of these activities need to happen every quarter. The challenge is to prioritise the amount of our time and money we spend on each. And to review and change this balance every quarter as conditions change.

**And lots more**

I've written a [handbook for product managers](https://scottcolfer.com/product-management-handbook/) that's main success is describing the product management concepts, skills, and principles most commonly valuable in my 1:1s with product managers over the last few years. When I first started writing it a couple a years ago the weakest section was the 'product leadership section'. I didn't really know what to put. At the time I didn't really have Lead Product Managers. And the discussion around Senior Product Managers was simply 'how many products can we get them to manager?'. We've moved on since then and see Senior Product Managers as group product managers, responsible for the overall value proposition for a group of products. And I now realise that product leadership is mainly about taking the skills we learned as product managers for product teams and adapting them for a greater scale as we move into management teams. Most of the product management skills in the [handbook for product managers](https://scottcolfer.com/product-management-handbook/) can be usefully adapting to work at scale, in management teams.

## Value at an organisational level

Lots of teams and organisations struggle to define what they really do, and what makes it valuable. More accurately, they struggle to be honest with themselves: goals and visions describe what they think they do or what they'd like to do. They need help to desribe what they really do, and what their users genuinely value. This was a key theme of the Mind the Product 2018 conference in London, with Janice Fraser's talk about [uncovering the truth](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2019/01/uncovering-the-truth-by-janice-fraser/) being particularly insightful. 

Product leaders play a critical role in uncovering the truth about what their organisations do, and what makes it valuable. It's an essential foundation for good product strategy. Value is context-specific so it's unhelpful of me to make sweeping generalisations in the few words I'm allowing myself here. Instead I'll highlight the book that has most helped my thinking: [The Art of Business Value](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-art-of-business-value/) by Mark Scwartz.  It's the most thorough yet concise description of value cross-sector that I've encountered.

I've done a lot of thinking about value in my context: developing B2B software within public services. It's so critical to my role that I've shared my current thinking in a series of posts starting [here](https://scottcolfer.com/2019/03/17/digital-transformation-business-model.html).

# Afterword

There we have it. That's my product leadership journey to date. It's not a grand statement on all product leadership but it is an honest summary of my personal journey. 

The my skills have been tested. 50+ product managers. Organisational merger. Multiple business units. We've scaled well. 

Context is important. 
I'm writing about product leadership in a very large enterprise, from the perspective of a mature (6 years +) digital function. If you're a product leader in a startup (below 5 years) or a small/medium enterprise then some of what I've said will be more or less relevant to you. You might be lucky and not have much tech-debt to pay down. However, I've also worked in a tech startup and know that a toxic founder can generate a lot of organisational dysfunction is a short amount of time. So maybe perceived differences are not pronounced as we might assume. 
I'm also writing from a non-profit environment, so people working in profit-driven organisations may find some of what I've said less relevant to them. Once again though, we still [measure value in non-profit environments](https://scottcolfer.com/2019/03/19/value-without-profit.html), we just measure mission success rather than profit. Other than that, the same product management concepts work in both spaces.

This post is marks the end of the beginning of my development as a product leader. I've learned enough to realise that I have a lot to learn. So I'm sharing this to spark conversation that continues my learning (aka [making things open makes things better](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better)). Much of my approach to product leadership is a patchwork of things I've learned from others. I'm going to test this post out with many of those people, and no doubt improve it based on those tests. I lead a profession of 50+ product managers and our 1:1s and meetups are a continual source of learning and refinement. I meet with many of the Heads of Product in government at least once every couple of months, where we're all working together to improve the value of product leadership. I have a group of product management friends built-up over the years who I meet up with for dinner every few months. Mind the Product started a spin-off [meetup for product leaders](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/product-leadership/) in April 2017 that's been great as a safe space for Heads of Product, Directors of Product, and Chief Product Officers from all sectors and all types of organisations to talk openly and honestly about our challenges and successes. And the people referenced in this post are just a small indication of the many people who kindly make time to write down their thoughts and share the on the internet, for free, in order to help other product leaders. Product management is stepping out from behind technology, into management teams. Product Leadership is new and sketchy. Which is great, because it's up to all of us to determine what it becomes.
