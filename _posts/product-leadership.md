# Prologue

"Scott, are you OK? You look exhausted."

December 2016. Several people have asked me if I'm OK over the last couple of months. Two or three of them make time to chat with me. I bump into Georg, our executive coach, whilst getting some water in the kitch and he asks "Scott, are you OK? You look exhausted." I give a quick version of what's on my plate from behind tired eyes.

2016 saw me shift from senior product manager, to lead product manager, to unofficial head of product. In December of that year I'm directly managing 15 product managers (along with a couple of Web Operations Engineers), have just completed 5 simultaneous recruitment campaigns, and remain hands-on product manager for a couple of teams. I've just completed work with other heads of product on the first role description and career pathway for product managers in government which has been a great experience but taken a lot of time and effort. This was too much for one person to do. I was burned out.

Georg suggests I make time to have a chat with him to see if we improve things. A few days later we meet in the week before the Christmas break. And so began my real development as a product leader.

***

This post is based on my experiences of moving from product management to 'product leadership' over the last few years. 

My recent perspective from within a large organisation, within an even larger organisation that has existed for a long time and needs to change how it operates in under to survive in the modern age. My perspective is also from a specialist leadershop role (product management) at a time when leaders are often generalists. 

More specifically:
- I’ve progressed from product management to product leadership over the last 3 years
- There’s some way to go until product leadership roles are understood and used to their full potential. ‘Senior Product Manager’ and ‘Lead Product Manager’ can sometimes mean ‘really busy product manager’ in practice. ‘Head of Product’ can sometimes mean ‘glorified people manager’ in practice.
- I don’t have a product leader responsible for my support and development
- There’s a lot of guidance and training on product management. There’s relatively little on product leadership

If you're context is similar to the above then this post will be of particular relevance to you, however if you're willing to squint then most current or aspiring product leaders will see something of interest.

# Chapter 1: Leadership

Georg and I had leadership coaching sessions together throughout 2017 that helped me to reflect on what I was learning about leadership. First thing-up was to figure out what general leadership means whilst working with agility. Georg's first recommended reading was [Management 3.0](https://jurgenappelo.com/management-30/) by Jurgen Appelo. This book helped consolidate on the type of leader I wanted to be, and the types of leaders I didn't want to be. It comes highly recommended. The short version is that **modern leaders need the ability to do the right thing and do the thing right in the midst of complexity** ('management 3.0') whilst avoiding hierarchical leadership ('management 1.0'), and meme leadership ('managment 2.0').  

### Leadership 1.0: Old hierarchies

Organisations with outdated, hierarchical structures are designed and managed in a top-down fashion, and power is in the hands of the few. The people at the bottom have little money, few responsibilities, and little motivation to do a good job. This is often described as 'command-and-control'. It is often mistakenly likened to a military-style structure, however the military abandoned this approach many decades ago. This type of leadership can function in conditions of high-certainty and low-change but is poorly suited to conditions of low-certainity and high-change: when decisions are made by a small number of people, the organisation maximum speed of response to changing conditions is dicated by the decision-making capability and speed of that small number of people.  

The Government of the United Kingdom is arguably around 800 years old. It is old. But times, they are a-changing. The [information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age) has seen massive and rapid change in the UK that has irrevocably changed the relationship between the public and Government in the UK, with much higher expectations of public services. The UK's Civil Service is undergoing significant change to keep-pace with this change. John Manzoni, Chief Executive of the Civil Service, challenged Civil Service leaders to leave old hierarchies behind and embrace a new type of leadership in his [Civil Service Transformation speach](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/civil-service-transformation-speech) in early 2018: 

"We need leaders with empathy, who can manage their teams through transformation and encourage continuous improvement. Leaders with broader experience, who are effective in a complex, multidisciplinary world, who lead with their hearts and their guts, as well as their heads, who see the big picture. Leaders whose instincts - developed through experience - are collaborative; who are used to working across boundaries, confident beyond their own professional area, and inspire and empower their teams."

So I wanted to avoid command-and-control leadership by focussing on emapthetic, collaborate, empowering leadership - in order to help build an organisation that can respond quickly and decisively to the rapid changes taking place in modern UK.

### Leadership 2.0: Meme leadership 

There are add-ons designed the problems of old, hierarchical organisations. To summarise and paraphrase Jurgen Appelo, there are a lot of leadership fads (he gives Six Sigma as one example) that act as add-ons for hierarchical organisations. They ease the problems of these organisations without fundamentally changing the way that leadership takes place. Leadership 2.0 is just Leadership 1.0 with added-fads that release pressure built up within an old system.

I like the word 'fad' but think 'meme' works even better. [Simon Wardley](https://twitter.com/swardley) has used the word 'meme' to describe leadership strategy, and it's stuck with me. I think 'meme' is more forgiving than 'fad'. A fad is a 'trivial fancy adopted for a while with irrational zeal', whereas a meme a unit of cultural information that is transmitted from one mind to another through repeated action. The cultural information that starts a meme may be valuable but this value may be lessened through repeated transmission. I'm about to list some common leadership memes and want to clarify that the inherent concepts are valuable in each case, but repeated transmission sometimes breaks them free of their true meaning. Sometimes they swtich and become the opposite of their original intent. With that being said, here's my top-3 leadership memes :)

**'We're doing Agile' and 'Agile at Scale'.**

I'm going to stick my neck out and say that, for me, working with agility can be summarised as two things. Firstly, focus on outcomes over outputs. Secondly, release stuff early and often to check you're getting the outcomes you want. There's more depth to the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) than by brutally reductive summary. In fact, let's assume that my summary leaves a lot to be desired. The point is that working with agility is based on simple principles, by design.

'Agile at scale' has emerged as a concept in the last few years. At its heart, it's a great concept. It implies they following:
'Ok folks - you know that our delivery teams have been focussing on outcomes for users for a few years now - and it's improve the value of our products and services? Well, what if our middle-management and leadership teams did the same thing? And we used a common understanding of value to link-up the way that they layers of our organisation work together?' Or something like that. What this implies is that middle-management and leadership teams look at all of the years or work undertaken by their 'delivery' teams and realise that they now need to do the same thing themselves.

What sometimes happens is that a framework like Large-Scale Scrum ('[LeSS](https://less.works/)') or the Scaled Agile Framework ('[SAFe](https://www.scaledagile.com/)') is lifted and shifted onto an organisation without changing any of that organisation's fundamental structure. This isn't a dig at either of those frameworks. If an organisation has gone through 1-5 years of organisational transformation at all levels, and found that Scrum (for example) is the perfect framework to drive its product tactics and found another tool to drive product strategy and business strategy then something like LeSS could be a great fit. However, if it's dropped onto an organisation without leadership and management structures fundamentally switching to a focus on outcomes over outputs and releasing stuff early and often to check you're getting the outcomes you want, then it's chances of success are slim. It's likely to become an add-on to prop-up an old, hierarchical organisation. I've previously worked for a large enterprise that adopted [scrum of scrums](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum-of-scrums/). The products within the scrum of scrums didn't have sufficient alignment of to allow it to work, and there was no corresponding transformation of management. The experiment was quietly dropped after a couple of months. I've shared this experience with a few folks over the years and periodically I get an email saying like ''My leadership team is about to adopt Less/Safe/etc. It's going to be a car crash. How do I help them to stop before it's too late?'. The struggle is real.

Working with agility means something like focussing on outcomes over outputs and releasing stuff early and often to check you're getting the outcomes you want. If every level of your organisation is expected to do this, and to work with all other levels of your organisation in doing so, then you're working with agility at scale.

Term 'digital' criticised in select committee as unclear. Agree. Let's clarify. Digital transformation work: people, process, etc
Delivery is the strategy

delivery is the strategy - this is not good enough, needs same sophistication as our development teams

Meme leadership is perhaps more insidious than hierarchical leadership because it is less obvious and can lead to a culture of virtue signalling.

AVOID MEME LEADERSHIP

### 3. Complexity

Bring the above together:
- command and control can work when you have high confidence in the problem you're solving, high confidence in the solution, strong problem/solution fit, and negligible changes in conditions. 

Lean Enterprise quote:
"The biggest challenge faced by leaders and managers in complex enterprises is this:
‘How do we help people within our organisation to make good decisions (i.e. to act in the best interests of our organisation) given that they can never have sufficient information and context to understand the full consequences of their decisions, and given that events often overtake our plans?"


Often described as 'seeing the bigger picture' but left no more defined that this.
Mind the Product (?) suggests that systems thinking is a growth area for development for product leaders. 
Management 3.0 by Jurgen Appelo takes this a step further and describes this as complex sytems theory (chapter 3), with systems thinking being just one way of trying to understand complex systems. There are mutliple models, each of which has inspired multiple techniques. _Systems thinking referred to on p49_ 
Seeing the bigger picture includes learning from others. Look sideways.

## Mission command

Outside of technology we are dependent on partnerships - need people who can understand the whole system.
Complex Adaptive System
Mission Command

Agile leadership is achieved through mission control. 
Lean Enterprise
- do you have buy-in for mission control?
-- Janice Fraser, buy-in

Five reflections on building a misson command culture [part 1](https://thearmyleader.co.uk/five-rules-of-thumb-to-build-a-mission-command-culture-part-1/) and [part 2](https://thearmyleader.co.uk/five-rules-of-thumb-to-build-a-mission-command-culture-part-2/):

- make sure you have a vision
- overcommunicate clarity, at least 2 levels down
- delegate until you feel uncomfortable and then delegate some more
- to encourage hones views, start by asking the most junior opinion and then work your way up the group
- treat other teams as if they are part of your team.

## Leadership dimensions

Value of coaching (used to do; leaders find it difficult to be vulnerable; feel they have to be strong)
Georg's model: leadership dimensions
- my self
-- easy to carry a lot
- people
-- often where we first get into leadership
-- coaching; community of practice; role description; skills; career pathway; define in relation to others; handbook; etc
- organisational improvement
-- nearly burnt myself out by trying to improve everything at once but govt is too big to be 'saved' by one person. Do one thing at a time. Even a single bit of one dept can have enough problems to lead to burnout for someone drive by perfection and unrelenting standards. Prioritise the most valuable thing. Focus on finishing over starting.
-- PDCA
-- Have to be as interested in your organisation as you have previously been in a single team. It's not 'stakeholders', it's colleagues.  The organisation is your team. It's not 'the business', it's our organisation. It's just large and complicated. Need to be as interested in organising large organisation as you are in the problem space of your product(s).
- value management
-- our USP, where a lot of product leadership sits
-- art of business value
- time
-- design sprints. we should design our time as well as we design our products.
-- an interesting one. Used to take this narrowly as 'we all have limited time in the day'. Now understand that it's broader than that: things take time. Took 2-3 years to develop as product leader. Took 1-2 years before I could start delegating in earnest.

Make all of this work visible in leadership plans; not just delivery work

# Chapter 2: Product leadership

Previously took identity from 'hands-on' product management - worried at loss of product management when moving into 'managing people'.

Digital is . . . 
Tends to only focus on technology
Product interested in the others
Product is a business function, not a technology function
Digital transformation is change of all the above

Symptom of the above: tech startups or previously tech teams (ass we're often in in govt) might better understand technology profession - so may be more open to Chief Technology officer/technology leadership than product leadership. Might need to hit a problem before value of the profession is seen (e.g. Financial Times - or once it's a certain age and is judged by outcomes, not outputs).

You are the product manager for a management team. Product is a busines function, not a technology function. Meliss Perri tweet.
- 'do you mind that you're just managing people?' What are you doing now? Product managers don't do anything, we think and we talk. The job is always about people.
- 'don't you need to stay 'hands-on'? Otherwise you'll lose your skils'. You are hands-on. You're simply the product manager for your management team. You do everything you did in a propudct team, just adapted for a management team
Different to product team. Often may have basic understanding of working with agility. Don't spend much time together so takes a long time to build trust and performance (not co-located, rarely multi-disciplinary, often limited face-to-face time).
Equivalent of a user story at leadership level: opportunity outline
Senior product manager = associate product leader
- when I began my role, the disucssion was simply 'how many products can we get a senior to manage?'

Prioritisation quadrant:

- improve products
- improve relationships
- org debt
- org innovation

Expert: understand rules well enough to bend them, break them, and remake them.
