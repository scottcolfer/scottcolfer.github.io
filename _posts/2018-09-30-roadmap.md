I’ve now been working in government for over three years and product roadmaps have been a recurring theme. Not surprising, given that I'm a product manager? Well no - but the real reason they've been such a recurring theme is that I've found the humble product roadmap to be the 'face' for product management as a whole. Government contains lots of product managers who're new to product management - and lots of product managers who're new to government - and lots of people who're new to the concept of product management. The product roadmap often becomes the site for exploring and explaining product management as a whole, for better or for worse. So, in January 2017, I ran a session at the cross-government product meetup about what had worked and what hadn’t worked when attempting a portfolio-level roadmap in government. The later [post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/how-we-are-using-roadmaps-in-government/) referring to my session generated requests for help from other government departments who wanted to introduce or improve their use of product roadmaps, so much so that I wrote a follow-up [post](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/08/03/make-the-most-of-your-roadmap/) for the Government Digital Service, sharing simple tips for using product roadmaps. Once again, this generated multiple requests for help from other government departments (and a Local Authority) . . . so I started work on further support for roadmaps in the form of a diagram of a ‘good’ roadmap, with notes to explain the core concepts at play. I tweeted a [picture](https://twitter.com/scottcolfer/status/990995579621789696) of version 2 of this diagram that once again got a bunch of responses, including a [suggestion](https://twitter.com/bfgmartin/status/991242502610083840) to draft something for Mind the Product - which you can see [here](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2018/09/product-roadmaps-in-five-easy-pieces/).

That's probably as many posts as I can usefully write on the topic - but if you're a government department, government delivery agency, or local authority and would like a chat about roadmaps then please feel free to get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottcolfer).
