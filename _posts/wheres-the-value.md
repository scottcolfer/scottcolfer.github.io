Where's the value in digital transformation?

Value is the most important aspect of agile - but completely undefined

Public value

Service separation

B2B value

B2C value

## Political value

What everyone gets wrong about stakeholder https://melissaperri.com/blog/stakeholders Stakeholders have specific influence and knowledge that can help your product.

Political needs may not have been clearly expressed to us, and may be disclosed by our bureaucratic rules.

Financial objective of non-profits: aim for liquidity - maximise the value of their available budget to accomplish their mission

“When an agile team self organises to meet business needs and deliver business value, it cannot just consider customer and user needs for its products. It must consider all of the needs of the organisation and all of the things the business values, and then self organise to meet all of those needs. The needs disclosed by bureaucratic rules are amongst those needs.”

Let’s look at those needs in government.

Public value:
“Bureaucracy delivers business value.”
‘the public’ (us) pays taxes which we invest in public services on their (our) behalf
deliver public value rather than private value
unique in that we have the authority to compel behaviour . . . but here we must consider, are we compelling behaviour because it makes the act of governing easier, or because it improves the value of public services . . . and we should consider the cost of non-compliance, and the magnitude of punishment for non-compliance when we compel behaviour (is there a cost to the public, e.g. fines or loss of freedom? is there a cost to government, e.g. cost of accommodating people in prison?) 
often there is no competitor; ‘competitor’ is not to get help and do it yourself
government value fairness (procurement, recruitment, etc)
transparency (time, cost, etc) and public accountability . . . “You find that the government is always in the public eye - the press is always reporting on government actions, and the public is quick to outrage [. . .] [so] government places a high value on transparency. While companies can keep secrets, government is accountable to the public and must disclose its actions and decisions. There is a business need for continued demonstrations of trustworthiness, or we might as well say a business value assigned to demonstrating trustworthiness.”
blame is quickly assigned within public services so government is highly risk averse, placing high business value on things that mitigate risk
the above values are needs of government and may sometimes contradict the value of a specific public service
‘mission’ value (e.g. departmental goals)
good ‘customer service’

## Mission value

Don't get lost in all of this.
Remember that value of users is primary. Need to meet needs of everyone. Accessibility. Assistance.

This is an important point. It's easy to get lost in government. Show how org value contexts are sometimes more complicated than those of our users. Run the risk that it takes more time and effort to meet the needs of the contexts of the government & the civil service than it does to meet the needs of our users.
For this reason: Our business strategy - simplify our value contexts.
