# Making it up as we go along

‘Welcome to the team! Now you’ll see we’re all making it up as we go along!’

I joined the Ministry of Justice’s Digital team in August 2015 and was greeted with that message by [Tom Dolan](https://twitter.com/tomskerous). Tom was on my interview panel and a few months later when I finally joined he spotted me on my first day. It was a comforting message. We were all there because of the pioneering, world-leading work going on. And - everyone was making it up as they went along. That’s as true today as it was then - we’re all still making it up as we go along. 

Digital Government is the home of pioneering, world leading work. And if it sometimes feels a little constrictive or a little prescriptive? That’s because it’s the result of people just like you, who were making it up as they went along. You have total permission to rework it and improve it so it works better. There’s an unwritten folk history to the Digital work in Government. There’s power in knowing some of the intent and messy reality behind stuff that has become ‘big’ and ‘official’. So here’s an anthology of Digital folk tales from my experience of some of that big and official stuff. These are personal stories. Don’t trust the teller, trust the tale. Let’s assume that I’ve got things wrong and am writing from my own subjective and limited perspective. But the sentiment is true in each case: great work was done, it is valuable, it is flawed and you can improve it.

## Tweaking the Service Standard

The [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) is a big reason why I joined Digital Government. I actually worked in ‘the normal’ Civil Service from 2006-2010 and partly left because I was excited about this agile, customer-centred way of working thing and couldn’t find a way to make it stick in my Civil Service roles. 

I moved over to non-profit and social enterprise world where I could use this approach. ‘[The Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup)’ was published a year later in 2011 and it pulled together this way of working in a smart, useable way. Me and my CEO were excited by it - it’s the subject of my [first ever blog post](https://scottcolfer.com/2012/06/05/lean-startup-for-product-managers.html) back in 2012. We successfully pitched for funding from the [Esmée Fairbairn Foundation](https://esmeefairbairn.org.uk/) to adapt if for the charity/non-profit/social enterprise space. But someone had beat us to it. We started to realise that the folks at the Government Digital Service were already doing something that largely fulfilled our intent. So we decided to pivot. Use the emergent Service Standard, Design Principles and Service Manual coming from them. And instead use our funding for a pot of discoveries to find the most valuable problems we could feasibly solve. We used The Lean Startup and the Service Standard and the influences on both of them, taking the bits from each that worked and leaving the bits that didn’t.

I re-joined the Civil Service in 2015 as part of the new Digital tribe. Working on the MOJ’s first platform (the [Cloud Platform](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/22/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-cloud-and-platforms-but-were-afraid-to-ask/)) I wanted to take a user-centred approach. It’s easy to think of components and platforms as ‘technical products’ but I don’t agree with this. They’re staff-facing products. The root of the work technical is ‘technique’. What people mean when they say ‘technical product’ is ‘it’s a product with techniques I don’t understand’. So, long story short: it’s a staff-facing product, built by WebOps engineers for Developers, who are users and deserve a user-centred approach. Me and the team elect to use the Service Standard in order to help with this. But the Service Standard doesn’t work ‘as is’ so we tweak each point. We never lower bar. But we totally allow ourselves to make it work for the real world that we’re working in. We allow ourselves to adapt each point by returning to the original intent and figuring out what that means for a staff-facing product consisting of mainly open-source tooling operating on top of cloud hosting. This approach works.

If The Lean Startup is behind the Service Standard, what’s behind The Lean Startup? Eric Ries, the author, is explicit on this. tates that it is based on:

- [Lean manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) - how to build things efficiently, based on decades of good practice in the manufacturing sector (particularly identified with Toyota)
- [Design thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking) - a set of tools and methods to help organisations design products based on the needs of users (this had particular influence on our [phases of agile delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery); many people first engaged with this via the Institute of Design at Stanford University, particularly their famous [Design Thinking Bootleg](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57c6b79629687fde090a0fdd/t/5b19b2f2aa4a99e99b26b6bb/1528410876119/dschool_bootleg_deck_2018_final_sm+(2).pdf)
- [Customer development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_development) - builds on the premise that when we start something new we have a lot of untested assumptions. Therefore we need to avoid doing anything based on these assumptions. Rather, we must do relevant and focused research before going ahead and building anything (this had particular influence on our [discovery phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works)); the book ‘[The Four Steps to Epiphany](https://web.stanford.edu/group/e145/cgi-bin/winter/drupal/upload/handouts/Four_Steps.pdf)’ by Steven Blank helped shape customer development
- [Agile development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) - an adaptive approach to software development that recognises that user needs and software itself evolves over time through the collaborative efforts of multidisciplinary teams working with (and based on insights from) their users; the [Agile Manifesto for Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/) is the driving force behind this.

We can adapt the Service Standard to our context as long as we remain true to its influences and intent. The Service Standard represents pioneering, world-leading work. It’s valuable, it’s flawed and you can improve it.

## The Five-Year Itch

It feels a bit like everyone’s leaving Digital Government right now doesn’t it? Some wag on Twitter suggested we started Digital Transfer News to share completed signings, deals and gossip :) Don’t worry, I think this happens every five years and everything will be OK.

Monday 15th August was my first day in Digital Government. I’d been attracted by the pioneering work of the Government Digital Service. And the leadership of folks like Mike Bracken and Tom Loosemore who I’d heard talking on the digital meetup circuit. 

Friday 12th August was when I read an article in The Guardian which asked ‘[Why are senior staff fleeing the Government Digital Service?](https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/aug/12/government-digital-service-staff-resignations)’. A lot of people left Digital Government at the tail-end of 2015 and into 2016. This had an impact on the mood. On a personal level I was thinking “oh no, have I joined too late just as it’s all coming to an end?’.

The answer was ‘no’. People change. Digital moves on. That last big change was around the five-year mark (ish) in the official history of Digital Government. We’ve hit the ten-year mark and I see something similar happening now, with lots of people leaving. But what I recognise is this also means that lots of people are moving up. And lots of people are moving in. Digital Government represents pioneering, world-leading work. It’s valuable, it’s flawed and you can improve it.
