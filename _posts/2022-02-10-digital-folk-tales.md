# Making it up as we go along

‘Welcome to the team! Now you’ll see we’re all making it up as we go along!’

I joined the Ministry of Justice’s Digital team in August 2015 and was greeted with that message by [Tom Dolan](https://twitter.com/tomskerous). Tom was on my interview panel and a few months later when I finally joined he spotted me on my first day. It was a comforting message. We were all there because of the pioneering, world-leading work going on. And - everyone was making it up as they went along. That’s as true today as it was then - we’re all still making it up as we go along. 

Digital Government is the home of pioneering, world leading work. And if it sometimes feels a little constrictive or a little prescriptive? That’s because it’s the result of people just like you, who were making it up as they went along. You have total permission to rework it and improve it so it works better. There’s an unwritten folk history to the Digital work in Government. There’s power in knowing some of the intent and messy reality behind stuff that has become ‘big’ and ‘official’. So here’s an anthology of Digital folk tales from my experience of some of that big and official stuff. These are personal stories. Don’t trust the teller, trust the tale. Let’s assume that I’ve got things wrong and am writing from my own subjective and limited perspective. But the sentiment is true in each case: great work was done, it is valuable, it is flawed and you can improve it.
