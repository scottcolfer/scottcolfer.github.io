# Product managers love food

Most of the posts on this blog are about product management. There’s a lot of product managers who’ve become friends. And most of our conversations inevitably move on to food at some point. Is it that most product managers love food? Or that the ones that love food are the ones I become friends with? I think a bit of both. But I’ve got a theory. Product managers aren’t the ‘doers’ in their teams. If we’re doing our jobs well, we don’t tell teams how to do their jobs. We define what we need to achieve and why we need to achieve it. So much of our role is about listening, thinking and speaking. Hopefully in that order. And that can be frustrating. Sometimes we want to get ‘hands on’ and do something ourselves. But that’s not really the job. So my theory is: we develop deep, creative hobbies out in the real world to make up for it. So I think that most product managers I’ve gotten to know have a deep love for food. It’s certainly true that I do.
