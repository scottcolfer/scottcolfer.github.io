These were some of my favourite books, films and videogames in 2017. 
They weren't necessarily released in 2017, and 2017 wasn't necessarily the first time I read/watched/played them, but they were all enjoyed in 2017 none the less.

## Books

*I tended to favour ghost stories, horror and science fiction.*
