# Films and books

I'm currently enjoying science fiction, horror, and ghost stories (but you'll find other genres too).
2018 wasn't necessarily the year they were released or even then first time that I watched/read it - but it was enjoyed this year none the less.
There are a lot of films below - the two that have probably stuck with me the most are [Daphne](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5467554/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) & [The Transfiguration](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5039088/?ref_=nv_sr_1).
