# Start with why

I’m writing a booklet called **‘New Wave Product’** that's a sort of **manifesto for pragmatic product management**. Most popular guidance feels ‘purist’ and narrowly focused on metrics-driven tools, models and frameworks. 

Lots of entry and mid-level product managers I’ve managed and met will hoover-up this purist guidance, find it doesn’t work in the messy reality of their organisation and feel like they’re not doing proper product management. 

Lots of organisations wanting to be ‘product-led’ will spend time on OKRs and roadmaps and introducing product managers but realise this doesn’t address their underlying problems.

My truth is that a roadmap has never really changed anything. The popular tools, models and frameworks can be of help but it’s coaching, managing change and negotiation that have led to the transformation. 

I think that product’s all up in its head and it needs to get out into the world and be a little more pragmatic. ‘New Wave Product’ is an argument for broadening product culture and to think about people as much as metrics. It’s a call for pragmatic product.

# How

‘New Wave Product’ will likely have five sections explaining where we’ve got a little lost and how we reintroduce pragmatism. There will be:

- an introduction improving and expanding on this blog post
- a section on the mis-adventures of an organisation becoming ‘product-led’ as a vehicle for digital transformation
- a section on the experiences and signals over the years I missed, all of which were telling me that something was missing in how we often define product
- a little inconoclasm, returning to our sacred texts to see their strengths and weaknesses
- and finally the key principles for new wave product as a call to action and a manifesto for pragmatic product.

I've been writing blog posts since the 2000s and writing product-guidance for over a decade, including the popular [Product Management Handbook from 2018](https://scottcolfer.com/product-management-handbook/). I took the [Faber Academy's](https://faberacademy.com/) 'creative non-fiction' course at the beginning of 2024 which helped me find my own voice and improve my storytelling.

# What

I’m doing this as an A5 booklet, probably around 16 pages in length. I’d like to draft this in just a couple of months and I’d like people to read it in a few minutes. I’d like to do the hard work to make it simple. I’ll print 25-50 copies of the draft and share with folks for feedback, then improve, then do the same thing with a slightly larger print run. I’m going to keep things as simple as possible and strip out anything that distracts from getting it out into the world asap.
