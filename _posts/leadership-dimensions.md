## What does 'leadership' mean?

In my [last post](http://scottcolfer.com/2018/01/12/leadership.html) I shared that I need to pivot my professional development from product management to product leadership, which means that I need to figure out what 'leadership' actually means. The importance of 'context' became clear to me in my [last post](http://scottcolfer.com/2018/01/12/leadership.html), so I'm looking to define what leadership means for me (rather than what leadership means in an abstract sense).

## What does 'leadership' mean for me?

For me, leadership has several dimensions. [This model](https://georgfasching.com/introducing-the-prime-leadership-model/) has helped me to identify these dimensions and begin to think about them, and how I develop within them. The model was developed by my colleague Georg Fasching, who's been working with me in a leadership coaching context for around a year (and agile coaching for a year before then). Georg has developed this [leadership model](https://georgfasching.com/introducing-the-prime-leadership-model/) during this time, based in part on the context in which I'm working (leadership team in a large enterprise with a matrix management structure, in the process of 'digital transformation'), so based on my working relationship with Georg, the quality of his model, and our shared context, it works well for me.

If I take Georg's model and personalise it for my needs right now, I understand leadership to have the following dimensions:

- **my self** - I find it important to remember that I am not defined by my job, and my work is not my life. My partner, my family, my friends, my interests and my hobbies are the main focus of my life. My job and the mission of my organisation (my work life) are really important to me but my partner, my family, my friends, my interests and my hobbies (my real life) are more important to me. Both are important to me but my real life is more important than my work life.
- **people** - My work life is shaped by people. I'm part of an organisation that builds user-centred (i.e. people-centred), public services. I'm head of the and part of our product management profession, so work with peers who share a passion for prioritising the most valuable problems that people face, and then working with other people to solve those problems. I guess I can summarise this as '[empathy](http://scottcolfer.com/2015/07/23/empathy-and-digital-transformation.html)': I need to focus on what empathy looks like in a leadership role.
- **organisational improvement** -
