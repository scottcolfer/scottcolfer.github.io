title: "Where's the value in digital transformation? Part One."

The principles of Agile Manifesto say that value is the most important thing to focus on but then forgets to say how to figure out what's valuable. So we need to plug this gap and figure out what value means for us, then check that the stuff we're building through build-test-learn feedback loops.

We have an additional challenge when doing this in government because we're not foccussed on making a financial profit.

Value is the most critical aspects of working with agility. It's the focus of the first of the [principles behind the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). If we were to tweak the Agile Manifesto for Software Development so that it works better as am [Agile Manifesto for Public Services](https://scottcolfer.com/2017/06/03/agile-manifesto-public-services.html) then the first principle would be that:
> Our highest priority is to satisfy the public through the early and continuous delivery of valuable public services.

This is great! 'Digital transformation' which is about helping organisations to work with agility, and focussing on value is one of the most important aspects of working with agility, so we just need to go ahead and do that!

Except that the Agile Manifesto gives us nothing to help figure out what value is. Subsequent frameworks like [Scrum](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) also neglect to help us figure out what value is. Most guides seem to assume that 'value' is figured out somewhere else by 'the business' then presented to delivery teams in a fully-formed stated to be consumed and acted upon. In reality, it's often the case that 'the business' is waiting for delivery teams to present their defintion of value. And so we can end up in a space where we're all delivering 'stuff' early and often without an honest sense of whether it's truly valuable.

Working with agility makes the promise of focussing on value but then witholds the means by which to define value. This is a trickey state of affairs for a product manager because our focus is on managing value: we are responsible for the outcomes of our products and services. It's the role of the product manager to define the value of their products and services - so that's what I'm going to try and do :)

> "Leaders create the language of the organisation; they set up incentives and define value in a way that elicits the descired outcomes. They define what it *valued* in order to deliver on the organisation's mission." ***The Art of Business Value**,  Mark Schwartz* 

The main principle I need to remember is that **value is context specific**. Trying to define 'value' in the abstract is a fool's errand. I work on public services within the Civil Service as a 'digital' specialist, so this is my context.

## Value part 1: Public value

Value in a commercial setting is quite commonly understood. When the context is 'private value', we're all familiar with measuring value through things like profits or return to shareholders. The Civil Service is not a commercial setting so profit or return to shareholders are pretty usefuless ways of measuring our value. Our goal is satisfy the public's needs through public services, so **our context is [public value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_value)**. 

How do we measure public value? Public value is defined as two things in the context of public service delivery by the Civil  Service:

- **mission value**: achieving the mission of your department as well as possible whilst hitting financial targets for liquidity
- **political value**: maintaining the trust of the public in Government 

### Mission value

Non-profits measure their value through the extent to which they achieve their mission whilst also meeting financial targets for liquidity. 
In practice this means doing as much as possible towards their mission within their budget, and trying to increase their budget if they can see the need to do so.

Mission value usefully describes the main priority for everyone in the Civil Service: our main goal is to achieve our mission as well as possible whilst also meeting financial targets for liquidity. Every Department in Government has a different mission, and its important for each Department to specific how the success of their mission will be measured. What's our one metric that matters (this might change from reporting period to reporting period but it's important to have one at all times)? What are our other key performance indicators? What's the benchmark for these metrics at the beginning of the financial year? By how much do we need to improve them by the end of the financial year in order to justify the investment that the public has made in our mission? How do we know if we've succeeded or failed?

### Political value

Things aren't as simple as that because these public services are delivered through Government. I'm privileged to live in a [liberal democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy) with a [parliamentary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system). We also have a [constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy). These social systems are the social bedrock of our society and critical for our country to continue to run as it does. This means that it's important to maintain the trust of the public in these social systems, something that we define as **political value**. 

Political value may not be clearly expressed to us but is often disclosed by bureaucratic rules. 

> "You find that the government is always in the public eye - the press is always reporting on government actions, and the public is quick to outrage [. . .] [so] government places a high value on transparency. While companies can keep secrets, government is accountable to the public and must disclose its actions and decisions. There is a business need for continued demonstrations of trustworthiness, or we might as well say a business value assigned to demonstrating trustworthiness [. . .] Blame is quickly assigned within public services so government is highly risk averse, placing high business value on things that mitigate risk." ***The Art of Business Value**,  Mark Schwartz* 

**Good bureaucracy** helps maintain the trust of the public in our critical social system and so delivers value. 

> “When an agile team self organises to meet business needs and deliver business value, it cannot just consider customer and user needs for its products. It must consider all of the needs of the organisation and all of the things the business values, and then self organise to meet all of those needs. The needs disclosed by bureaucratic rules are amongst those needs.” ***The Art of Business Value**,  Mark Schwartz* 

### Mission value should outweigh political value

It can sometimes feel as though policitcal value can contradict mission value. How can we test if this is the case, particularly since political value may not be clearly expressed? The answer is not to get lost. The needs of the public remain paramount and the majority of public value should always come from mission value. We have things like the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code) to help guide us, and remind us that we must have integrity, honesty, objectivity, and impartiality. Although it is true that civil servants are accountable to ministers, ministers have their own [code](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/672633/2018-01-08_MINISTERIAL_CODE_JANUARY_2018__FINAL___3_.pdf) which stresses that, "Ministers must uphold the political impartiality of the Civil  Service,  and  not  ask  civil  servants  to  act  in  any  way which  would  conflict  with  the Civil  Service  Code."

The needs of the public should always be the main focus of our work. We should be able to objectively say that at least 51% of the value of our work is defined by how well we are meeting our mission for the public. We should also acknowledge that maintaining the trust of the public in our core social systems is valuable and a worthwhile endevour. We can always check-in with ourselves and ask the simple question: [are we doing good?](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2019/01/lets-resolve-to-create-humane-products-in-2019/) 



OK, so we've set the context for ourselves: public value. But nothing seems very measurable yet. Not very [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm). Let's see if we can improve that.
