'Digital' means applying the culture, processes, business models, and technologies of the internet era to respond to people's raised expectations. - but digital transformation has remained largely focussed on technology. The service standard and spend controls have had huge impact on culture and processes - but arguably within the 'technology' bit of government. Transformation of business models remains conspicuously absent from digital transformation to date - I think business models can bring two missing pieces to the puzzle of digital transformation: (i) value; (ii) time.

'Delivery is the strategy' was the rallying call of digital transformation in government for the longest time but we're now being told that 'the era of move fast and break things is over'. The truth is that 'delivery is the strategy' is a tactic, it's something used at the beginning of digital transformation to build an organisation's emotional confidence in a new way of working. The era is of moving fast and breaking things isn't over, it's just realised that it doesn't hold all the answers and needs to go broader and deeper - beyond brand-new and public-facing, into legacy and staff-facing. 

The era of 'move fast and break things' ins't over. We still need that. But it can no longer be our exclusive focus. We need at least two sets of coniditions - explore, and exploit - we need to stop the all or nothing mentality that drives us to lurch from one to the other, and start using them both where and when they are most useful.
