# It's a wonderful time

Simon Wardley published a [thread of Tweets](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/951536659736203264) yesterday, with my take on it being that 'business strategy is in its infancy, with organisations often relying on meme copying and gut feel; there's an entire field yet to be discovered, to be understood - its a wonderful time.'


Pivot: product management > product leadership

I've been working as a Head of Product for since 2016 and it's taken me a while to get my head around the role.

I spent my career trying to do what's most valuable, rather than what I was told to do, seeking out spaces where I can focus on outcomes over outputs.
The role of Product Manager has given me the most opportunity to do this, so I've spent around a decade trying to hone my craft as a Product Manager so that I can work with my team to maximise the value of projects, products, and services. You can see the evidence of some of this development in this blog.
In the last few years, my work started to bleed out into broader organisation and system improvement, which brings us to today.

I'm choosing to pivot, tweaking my professional development so that it no longer focuses just on product management but also focuses on leadership, and helps me to figure out what product leadership means.
