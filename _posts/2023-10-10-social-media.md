# Substack

Why subscribe?

Each newsletter pulls together three topics - the only thing they have in common is that I enjoy them and want to share them with you.

Likely to include product management, coffee, mental health, knitting, YouTube scroll holes . .

I enjoy learning then simplifying concepts and ideas. It helps my understanding. A happy byproduct is that Iâ€™m good at sharing ideas with others, something else I enjoy. 

What?

Iâ€™ll write about product management and coffee (as youâ€™ll see on my blog). And share what Iâ€™ve learned about other things too, including e-bikes, knitting, short stories, coaching, digital transformation, mental health, clothing, obscure Youtube scroll-holes . . . and anything else quite interesting.

How?

Iâ€™ll share three things at a time. And keep each thing simple and brief. Iâ€™ll publish a newsletter when Iâ€™ve got something interesting to share and stay quiet when I donâ€™t.

A newsletter feels the most sociable way of sharing things in 2023. Iâ€™m now most active on LinkedIn but donâ€™t want to spam the folks there with non-work stuff. I enjoy writing on scottcolfer.com but now Twitter X has imploded I donâ€™t know where to share the posts. This newsletter allows me to write and share in the same place. And you decide if you subscribe and read what I share.

# Github Pages

tl;dr

Iâ€™ve blogged using WordPress since 2009 but been frustrated that backing-up posts wasnâ€™t easy. Greater familiarity with GitHub is useful for my current product. GitHub hosts a free, static site for each user through GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages can be married with Jekyll to create a blog hosted on GitHub.
Intro

Iâ€™m writing this blog post using Markdown and publishing it as a static website thanks to GitHub Pages. The blog is powered by Jekyll. This post to explains how and why Iâ€™m doing this.
How

Jonathan McGlone has published an excellent tutorial. Follow it and youâ€™ll create your own blog too. The tutorial assumes very little knowledge and covers Git (version control system), GitHub (hosting service for development using Git), GitHub Pages (free web pages from GitHub) and Jekyll (a â€˜staticâ€™ site generator, based on templates). Youâ€™ll then start writing blog posts using Markdown.
5 Whys

Why am I cheating on WordPress?
1. GitHub

Iâ€™d like to become a more sophisticated user of GitHub and I assume that regular, practical use is the best way to learn.
2. Documentation

Iâ€™m a product owner and have written about the importance of separating my product backlog from my development teamâ€™s sprint backlog. However, I could usefully have more knowledge of their activity and feedback they receive from our users in the form of issues. We believe in the agile manifesto, including â€˜working software over comprehensive documentationâ€™, but what weâ€™re finding is a need for more documentation so that we can remember and evidence user feedback and action weâ€™ve taken as a result. Our delivery manager smartly suggested making better use of GitHub before creating a new artefact so any opportunity for me to increase my understanding of GitHub in a practical sense without becoming a drain on the team (i.e. asking them to spend time mentoring me) is valuable. Additionally, most developers seem to hate using Google Drive so Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™d be much happier if they could collaborate on documents with me via GitHub instead.

My personal website has been active for years and is clearly something I regularly work on, so re-creating it using GitHub Pages and Jekyll should give me opportunities to learn more about GitHub in a practical sense.
3. Backup

WordPress is awesome. Back in 2009 (when I became more interested in web development because of the products I was working on), WordPress was a fantastic way to get online quickly. I wrote a now defunct food blog called â€˜The Boy Can Cookâ€™ that had a regular audience in the hundreds and led to some cool things (reviews, events, freebies).

Working with charities, social enterprises and startups, WordPress has been (and continues to be) a great way to make your mark. Services Iâ€™ve led like Young Dads TV, Mind of My Own, and Disclose Me (to name a few amongst many) have all benefitted from the WordPress universe.

WordPress started with personal blogs. My personal website is where I have most regular contact with WordPress. My use of the blog has changed over time and now I donâ€™t care how many readers I have, itâ€™s a public place to figure things out, get insights from a handful of people and return to in weeks/months/time to see what my thinking was like at a point in time. I think of my blog as a public place for private thoughts. My posts have value to me and so I want to back them up. This is not easy in WordPress. Itâ€™s not impossible but itâ€™s not as easy as other elements of the WordPress universe, so Iâ€™ve been looking for an alternative for some time now.
4. HTML

HTML is fascinating. HTML has emerged as a globally organised language and fundamentally changed the way we live our lives within twenty-five years. I recently heard a conversation between developers saying that websites written in basic HTML many years ago often remain functional and accessible. Iâ€™ve been playing with HTML on and off over the years, GitHub Pages gives me a chance to continue to do so (along with CSS) when editing the layout of the default home page and blog page of my site.
5. Time

I guess, ultimately, timeâ€™s moved on. WordPress was perfect for my needs when I first published a cookery blog blog back in 2009, and it was valuable for me to learn about it in order to inform services Iâ€™ve worked on over the last few years. Iâ€™m certain itâ€™ll continue to remain valuable for the forseeable future. Now though, my technical understanding of HTML and CSS has increased and the world has moved on. GitHub, pages and Jekyll are more useful to me right now, so Iâ€™m going to get stuck in. Wish me luck!

# LinkedIn

I'm active on LinkedIn and finding it useful. This time last year I wasn't. What's changed? 

Twitter was my main social network for work from 2008. I joined LinkedIn the following year in 2009 but it was always just there, in the background, stockpiling messages from recruiters. Twitter was a serendipity engine, generating links, friendships, opportunities and even jobs. It was conversational, fun, informal and part of 'working in the open'. If you were in the Digital bubble then Twitter was where it was at â€“ connecting on LinkedIn was a faux-pas, the party was taking place in 140 characters on the bird platform. Twitter was great for me. Until it wasn't. 

Last year there was a lot of kerfuffle over Twitter. Lots of people in my network drastically cut back on their tweeting. Some people left completely. My Twitter is a much quieter place now. There's a handful of people still active but it's largely tumbleweed. I'm one of the people who rarely Tweets in 2023. 

Other stuff happened personally too. I've got a young daughter and my time away from work is more precious than ever. I realised that maintaining an active Twitter presence (reading, responding, writing) takes time that I'd rather spend doing other things. Also, Twitter is now a very big space that doesn't feel as safe as it used to. The open, informal Tweets of old now feel like putting your head above the parapet during a siege.  

Lots of people moved to Mastodon. I've tried it a few times now and it hasn't 'stuck' for me. I'm looking for a casual platform that I can dip in and out of without a lot of effort, and that's not Mastodon right now . . .  

. . . but LinkedIn has always been there. For me it's got a pre-built network of 800+ professional contacts stretching back to 2009. LinkedIn's been there, in the background, for lots of people for a long time. It's more casual than other platforms, you can dip in and out of it, and that's . . . nice. I take a look every few days. I've got some interesting chats going on in the background via messages. It's a good way to see what folks are up to.  

The last laugh might go to LinkedIn. It's never been the cool place to be seen but it's the place most people return to. In 2023 it's my main professional social network. I'd be interested to see if LinkedIn has seen active use increase amongst existing members in the last year or so? Anecdotally, I've certainly seen that amongst my network. LinkedIn's never given me a reason to love it but neither has it given me a reason to leave. Over the course of 14-15 years it's become my best network of former and current colleagues and that's its value for me in 2023. I'm a LinkedIn convert, come at me ðŸ˜Š
