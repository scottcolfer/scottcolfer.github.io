There's something missing from digital transformation. 

'Digital' means applying the culture, processes, business models, and technologies of the internet era to respond to people's raised expectations. - but digital transformation has remained largely focussed on technology. The service standard and spend controls have had huge impact on culture and processes - but arguably within the 'technology' bit of government. 

Transformation of business models remains conspicuously absent from digital transformation to date. Business models are the missing part of the digital transformation puzzle

- I think business models can bring two missing pieces to the puzzle of digital transformation: (i) value; (ii) time.

Digital transformation: it's business time.
