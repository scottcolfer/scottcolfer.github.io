Here's how I blog. Previously written about why I blog.

# Pool of stuff

Google Apps
Google Photos, Google Keep, Google Docs

# Choosing a topic

# Writing the post

Spotify playlist - Techno
Github web via broswer: mximise the window, hit F11 to remove the toolbar and remove distractions
Writing using markdown http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html
If I'm writing something quickly to help me figure something out then I'll quickly scan then save.
If want it to be more useful to a wider group of people then I'll use Hemingway Editor, recommended by Nabeeha. http://www.hemingwayapp.com/
