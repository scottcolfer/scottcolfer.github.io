Here's how I blog. 
I've previousy shared [why I blog](https://scottcolfer.com/2019/06/19/blogging-product-leader.html). I'm currently in the middle of a post about product leadership that's kicking my ass. I wanted a break from that by writing something much simpler. So here's a post about how I blog.

# Inspiration

Writing can be daunting. I don't sit down with a blank page and the desire to write a post. I normally have lots of options floating around in the background. Some are undeveloped, others are almost complete posts already. I try to capture inspiration when it strikes so I've got a bunch of options at all times.

Professional challenges, product problems, leadership challenges, and interesting new ideas are normally swirling around in the back of my mind somewhere but it's hard to do something with them at work. The size and complexity of the organisation I work in and the pervasive communication tumbling through Slack means that I switch context many times a day.This makes reflective thinking difficult. To counter this I walk in to work at least once a week (ideally a couple of times a week). I live in Homerton and work in St James Park so the walk takes around 90 minutes. I'm normally listening to music but otherwise undistracted, enjoying the walk itself. A weird thing happens most days: as I walk along Fleet Street and approach the Royal Courts of Justice on the strand, an idea will pop into my head. A problem I've been thinking on for a while will resolve itself. A couple of previously unconnected trains of thought will usefully converge. It's very cool. Turns out that the most productive tool might be walking. I then switch to a more traditional productivity tool and make a note of the idea in [Google Keep](https://www.google.com/keep/). 

Alternatively, I sometimes read books on commute to work via Transport to London. The concepts are often familiar or I may be rereading something so I can often skim for useful points rather than reading slowly for depth of understanding. Perfect for public transport. If an idea or concept is particularly useful then I take a photo with my phone and save it in [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/).

Inspiration can strike anywhere. The above examples list the two most common ways that I get and capture ideas but it can happen after a chat with peers, challenge or success at work, or interesting insights from others.

Periodically an idea will become clear enough to expand. Brief notes in Google Keep and photos in Google Photos will be explored further in a Google Doc. These Google Docs sometimes become the bones of a post, funcitioning as a drafting process.

I typically have at least 10-20 ideas swimming around in the pool of my Google Apps. Many of them have been incubated for weeks, sometimes months. They've all been refined at least once or twice and several of them have been discussed a few times. All of this helps to figure out the angle that makes them intersting, and to remove the angst from writing.

Github web via broswer: mximise the window, hit F11 to remove the toolbar and remove distractions

If I'm writing something quickly to help me figure something out then I'll quickly scan then save.
If want it to be more useful to a wider group of people then I'll use Hemingway Editor, recommended by Nabeeha. http://www.hemingwayapp.com/
