The filtering process removes some of the coffee beans' oils and solids. This leads to a relatively light brew, helping you to notice the coffee's moredelicate flavours.
This is how I make a 250g of filtered coffee to go in a mug.

## Kit

- water filter
- Hario V60 Ceramic Coffee Dripper
- filter papers
- Hario Mini Mill Hand Coffee Grinder
- Salter digital scales
- funnel
- kettle
- mug

## Ingredients

- coffee beans
- filtered water

## Method

1. Boil enough water for your drink with some to spare
2. Place the filter cone on the mug and line it with a paper filter
3. Pour enough of the boiled water onto the paper to make it completely wet. This ensures that your coffee won't have a 'paper' taste
4. Measure 17g of coffee beans into the grinder *(note 1: The guidance is 6g coffee beans per 100g of coffee, making 15g coffee beans for a 250g mug, however this is only a guide and should be tweaked for personal preference. I seem to get my best results from 17g coffee beans. Note 2: To measure the coffee beans, I place the grinder on the scales without the arm or the lid but with the funnel in it. I then zero the scales and pour out the beams. This prevents the beans from going all over the place)*
5. Grind the coffee beans *(note 3: This has the benefit of letting the boiled water cool by a few degrees. Boiling water poured immediately onto ground coffee will burn some of it)*
6. Place the mug, cone and filter on the scales then pour the ground coffee into the filter and zero the scales
7. Slowly pour 250g the off-boiled water over the coffee grinds *(note 4: Pour slowly and ensure that you move the stream of water and cover all the grinds. Don't just hold it in one place or you'll not get the flavour from all the grinds)*
8. Leave the coffee until it's cool enough to taste, then drink.
