GitHub Pages is an excellent way to publish a personal website without the need for a hosting account, and Jekyll is an excellent way to publish a static blog from the text editor on your computor. I've written a post explaining why I'm [cheating on WordPress with GitHub Pages and Jekyll](http://scottcolfer.github.io/2016/04/09/personal-site-github-pages-jekyll.html).

I created this site in early 2016 using Jonathan McGlone's [excellent tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), however GitHub Pages has subsequetly become even easier to use.

General Assembly's HTML and CSS weekend course and [online tutorials](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/) helped me to understand the basic principles of web development.
