I love coaching, mentoring and speaking/presenting at meetups, shout if there's something that'd help you.

There's a bunch of topics I've helped people with trough coaching, mentoring, and speaking at meetups:

- **'Discovery'**: investing in the right the right opportunities
- **Career coaching**: breaking in to product, shifting from Senior to Lead/Head of Product, career progression after returning from maternity leave, peer coaching for other Product Leaders

# Career coaching

I've helped a load of people over the years with:

- breaking in to product
- promotion from Senior to Lead/Head of
- career progression after returning from maternity leave
- peer coaching for product leaders
- non-directive performance coaching for any leader
- getting meta, I've supported other people to develop in non-directive performance coaching for themselves

# ‘Discovery’: How to choose the right opportunities 

I can focus on areas like:

- What does a successful Discovery look like?
- What are the common Discovery mistakes and how do we avoid them?
- 10 experiments to try and improve your Discovery
- Wtf is ‘pre-Discovery’?
- How to use Discovery as a key element of agile governance
- . . . or anything else, just shout.

Context: I reviewed 50+ Discoveries in Central Govt after introducing an approach to doing them well.This followed 5 years of doing them myself, culminating in leading a cross-govt review and retrospective of Discovery to learn how to run them better. Most recently I’ve introduced Discovery to Local Govt.
