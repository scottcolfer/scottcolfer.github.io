I love coaching. I got loads from generous people at the start of my career, it's only fair to pay it back. 

- **Career coaching**: breaking in to product, shifting from Senior to Lead/Head of Product, career progression after returning from maternity leave, peer coaching for other Product Leaders
- **Help with blogging and speaking**: finding your voice

## Career coaching

I've helped a load of people over the years with:

- Breaking in to product
- Promotion from Senior to Lead/Head of
- Career progression after returning from maternity leave
- Peer coaching for product leaders
- Non-directive performance coaching for any leader
- Getting meta, I've supported other people to develop in non-directive performance coaching for themselves

## Help with blogging and speaking

People have found the following helpful:

- Listening: I’ve listened to someone talk-through what they’re interested in then played back what stands out as potential topics for a blog post of talk.. Then listened to that some more and help them draft a story from it. 
- Mentoring: Sharing the mechanics of preparing a blog post or talk
- Confidence: Supporting people to build the confidence needed to share something publicly. Some folks have realised that they didn’t feel like they had permission to have a voice, and this has been the start of a much deeper, more valuable journey of their own to find, trust and own their voice.
