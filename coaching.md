# ‘Discovery’
## How to choose the right opportunities 

I could focus on areas like:

- What does a successful Discovery look like?
- What are the common Discovery mistakes and how do we avoid them?
- 10 experiments to try and improve your Discovery
- Wtf is ‘pre-Discovery’?
- How to use Discovery as a key element of agile governance
- . . . or anything else, just shout.

Context: I reviewed 50+ Discoveries in Central Govt after introducing an approach to doing them well.This followed 5 years of doing them myself, culminating in leading a cross-govt review and retrospective of Discovery to learn how to run them better. Most recently I’ve introduced Discovery to Local Govt.
