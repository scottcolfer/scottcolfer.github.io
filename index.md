This site is a collection of my field notes: reflections, insights, and observations from my work in product management, strategy, and digital transformation. From product leadership to systems thinking, I explore the challenges and opportunities of working in complex services. Explore posts on product management, strategy, leadership, digital transformation, and a little bit about coffee from 2012-present. These notes inform my [Product in Service Month Note](https://scottcolfer.substack.com/).
