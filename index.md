Love products that improve lives. I have worked on products and services with a social mission for over fifteen years - currently Head of Product for the [Ministry of Justice](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice/). This is a personal blog about product management, product leadership, digital transformation, and coffee.
