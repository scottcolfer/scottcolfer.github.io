# Less woo-woo more you-you

It's rare to get time to think. This is about making space to figure something out. It's not therapy (although it can feel therapeutic) but is about the power of thinking out loud when making a decision.

**Sessions are free** whilst I practise and learn, this means I'll have notes with me while I memorise the cards and their meanings. Whilst I'm learning, I'm just doing this with friends, family, colleagues, neighbours (and their friends too). I'm based in Homerton (Hackney, London) and can do readings in the Hackney area . . . or I can bring my cards along if we were going to meetup somewhere anyway. 

## Feedback

"It blew my mind, the cards were spot-on. I've taken a photo of my reading so I can learn more about them." - M.

"I would never normally do something like this but because it was you I gave it a go, it was so nice to have time to think." - S.

## Here's the deal

We'll pull three cards in the main bit of the session. They'll provide prompts. I'll listen and guide you. You'll create a story that helps make sense of something going on in your life.

## Skills and training

I learned to read the Tarot at [Treadwells](https://www.treadwells-london.com/) in London, studying with [Delphine Fortuna](https://www.delphinefortuna.com/about). I'm still practising which means that I'll have notes with me whilst I continue to memorise the cards and their meanings. It also means that my sessions are free until the end of 2024.

I'm also a trained, non-directive performance coach and have been practicising for almost twenty-years. This has the biggest impact on my approach to reading Tarot. I believe the head that holds the problem also holds the solution, we just need help to get there sometimes. There's real power in thinking out loud while someone listens. I use the cards as prompts for you and ask critical questions to help you move your thinking on by one or two steps. I won't offer life-advice or suggest that the cards are trying to tell you something (and would consider it unethical for me to do this). I'll just help you figure out what the cards can usefully mean for you right now.

## Worried or dubious?

You've got mixed-feelings abut Tarot reading, right? You're not sure about all this mystical stuff . . . or you're worried about what the cards might tell you? Well I don't believe the deck is mystical or that it tells you anything. I think it's cards with pictures on them. And these images are archetypes that mean something to each of us. You'll use them to tell a story that helps you figure something out.
