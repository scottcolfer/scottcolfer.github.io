# Less woo-woo more you-you

It's rare to get time to think. This is about making space to figure something out. It's not therapy (altough it can be therapeutic) but is about the power of thinking out loud when making a decision.

**Sessions are free** until the end of December 2024 whilst I practice and learn, this means I'll have notes with me whilst I memorise the cards and their meanings. 

**Get in touch on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/psychotropicscott/)** to setup a session.

## Here's the deal

We'll pull three cards in the main bit of the session. They'll provide prompts. I'll listen and guide you'll create a story to help you make sense of something going on in your life at the moment.

## Skills and training

I learned to read the Tarot at [Treadwells](https://www.treadwells-london.com/) in London, studying with [Delphine Fortuna](https://www.delphinefortuna.com/about). I'm still practising which means that I'll have notes with me whilst I continue to memorise the cards and their meanings. It also means that my sessions are free until the end of 2024.

I'm also a trained, non-directive performance coach and have been practicising for almost tenty-years. This has the biggest impact on my approach to reading Tarot. I believe the head that holds the problem also holds the solution, we just need help to get there sometimes. There's real power in thinking out loud while someone listens. I use the cards as prompts for you and ask critical questions to help yu move your thinking on by one or two steps. I won't offer life-advice or suggest that the cards are trying to tell you something (and would consider it unethical for me to do this). I'll just help you figure out what the cards can usefully mean for you right now.

## Worried or dubious?

You've got mixed-feelings abut Tarot reading, right? You're not sure about all this mystical stuff . . . or you're worried about what the cards might tell you? Well I don't believe the deck is mystical or that it tells you anything. I think it's cards with pictures on them. And these images are archetypes that mean something to each of us. You'll use them to tell a story that helps you figure something out.
