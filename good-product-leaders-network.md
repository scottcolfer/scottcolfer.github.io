# Learn from the best

The largest network of its kind in the UK, we are a mix of over 100 product leaders from Central Government, Local Government, Higher Education, Healthcare, and Charities. A unique place to share, learn and build your network with peers.

## Why

I work across national government, local government, higher education, healthcare and charity and realised the challenges and oppportunities are the same . . . but couldn't find anywhere to network with peers to share and learn. I took a punt on LinkedIn and [asked](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scottcolfer_shout-if-you-want-to-join-a-whatsapp-group-activity-7165343423577714689-g5fS) if folks would join a WhatsApp if I set one up. That was February 2024 and the rest is history.

## How

- WhatsApp Community to share and learn from peers
- Monthly members video meetup on a curated topic

## Who

Anyone wanting to join with a title of Lead Product Manager, Principle Product Manager, Head of Product, Assistant Director of Product, Director of Product, or Chief Product Offier is immediately approved. For others we review their application. We don’t want to be purist around roles - we do want this to be a safe space for people with similar challenges and opportunities. Our priority is for Leads and above to have a safe space to be honest with their peers away from folks they manage.
